The provided chart presents a time-series line graph illustrating the trends of three sugar-related indices from January 1, 1990, to July 1, 2023. The indices include the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: Sugar and Sweets in the U.S. (symbol: CN), the global price of Sugar, No. 11, World (symbol: PB), and the global price of Sugar, No. 16, U.S. (symbol: PN). Each index provides insights into different aspects of sugar pricing and consumption on both a national and global scale.For the CN index, a steady upward trajectory is evident throughout the years. Starting in 1990 with a value of 100.0, the index climbs to a peak of 175.6 by July 2012. Despite minor fluctuations, this upward trend persists, with CN values reaching 177.1 in July 2015 after a brief dip in 2014. From mid-2015 until the chart's endpoint in July 2023, the values continue to rise consistently, peaking at 231.9, indicating a sustained increase in consumer sugar prices in the U.S.In contrast, the PB index begins with a downward trend from 1990 to 2002, reaching a low of 36.3. This is followed by a sporadic yet overall increasing pattern from 2002, culminating in a peak of 192.4 in January 2011. After a short-lived decrease until mid-2011, a significant decline is observed, dropping to 78.6 by July 2015. Thereafter, PB experiences an upward trend until October 2016, peaking at 141.8, but falls again to 73.4 by July 2018. The subsequent years show a resurgence, with values climbing to 170.0 by April 2023, highlighting the volatility and eventual recovery within the global sugar market.For the PN index, a similar complex pattern emerges. Initial growth from 1990 peaks at 102.4 by 1995, followed by a drop, with the lowest point at 76.5 around 2000. A renewed ascent occurs until 2006, peaking at 101.5, then surges between 2006 and mid-2011 to 168.0. However, a sharp decline follows, reaching 87.3 by early 2013. The subsequent recovery shows an increase to 129.4 by 2017, albeit with a minor drop in early 2018. A pronounced upward trend from 2018 to early 2023 marks the value's rise to 179.7, parallel to global sugar pricing tendencies.Analyzing the inter-dimensional trends, the data illuminates a consistent pattern of growth in Dimension CN, contrasting with the instability seen in PB and PN during earlier years, particularly around the declines from 2011 to 2013. However, all three dimensions align positively from 2018 onwards, suggesting a shared positive external influence affecting sugar pricing and consumer costs globally and within the U.S., culminating in a notable synchronized rise towards 2023.
