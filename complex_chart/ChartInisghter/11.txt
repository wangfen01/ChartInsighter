The chart captures the fluctuating trends in the ratio of inbound to outbound tourist trips for Iceland and Turkey from 1995 to 2022. Over this period, the line graph delineates significant temporal shifts in tourist dynamics between these two nations.In Iceland, the data starts with a downward trend from 1995 to 2006, where the ratio declined from 1.1446 to its lowest point at 0.9591. This initial reduction was followed by a robust increasing trend from 2006 onwards, culminating in a peak ratio of 3.7408 in 2020. However, the upward trajectory did not sustain as the ratio experienced a decline, falling to 3.1872 by 2021.Conversely, Turkey witnessed a gradual rise in the ratio of inbound to outbound tourist trips from 1995, achieving a local maximum in 2012 at approximately 6.1516. A more pronounced upward trend emerged after 2016, with the ratio skyrocketing to its zenith of 10.9295 in 2021. This peak was followed by a marked volatility and subsequent decline by 2022, where the ratio dropped to 6.9428.When examining these trends collectively, both Iceland and Turkey displayed a significant increase in their ratios during different periods post-mid-2000s. Iceland's sharp ascent occurred between 2006 and 2020, parallel to Turkey’s rapid escalation from 2016 to 2021. The simultaneous peaks around 2020 and 2021 indicate a shared upward momentum in tourist activity for these countries during these years. After reaching their respective peaks, both countries experienced a downturn in their ratios, with Iceland's decrease being more linear, while Turkey’s was characterized by fluctuations, highlighting differentiated post-peak behaviours in the tourism sector of these countries.
