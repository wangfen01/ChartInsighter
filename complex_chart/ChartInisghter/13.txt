The chart presents a line graph detailing the time-series trends in rental-related economic indicators in the United States, specifically focusing on the rent of primary residence and owners' equivalent rent from early 1984 to early 2015. Each line represents how these two dimensions behaved over this period, revealing changes in rent value percentages.For the rent of primary residence, a rising trend is noted from early 1984, culminating at 6.7% in November 1985. This was subsequently followed by a significant fall to 3.4% by July 1987. Afterward, a brief recovery was observed, peaking again at 4.2% in June 1988, followed by another decline to a low of 3.5% in December 1988. The trend saw another ascent, achieving 4.5% by September 1990, before plummeting to 1.8% in March 1993. Thereafter, a prolonged period of recovery occurred, with values rising steadily to 4.7% by November 2001, before a downturn saw it fall to 2.4% by January 2004. A subsequent climb ensued, peaking at 4.6% in March 2007, followed by a sharp downturn to -0.1% by May 2010. A recovery phase started in May 2010, hitting 3.6% by February 2015.The owner's equivalent rent demonstrated a broadly similar pattern, with a rising trend from January 1984 peaking at 6.6% by April 1986, followed by a decline to 4.2% by March 1987. A modest upward trend spanned until August 1990 with a peak at 6.2%, followed by a sharp decline to 2.8% by August 1991. Fluctuations continued until a notable ascent from December 1999 to December 2001 reached 4.5%, with a subsequent downturn to 1.9% by January 2004. Another rise was recorded by the end of 2006, peaking at 4.3%, before experiencing a drop to -0.3% by May 2010. The upward trend resumed post-2010, reaching 2.7% by July 2014.Examined across both dimensions, the trends exhibit a synchronized pattern during several intervals, notably in the early 2000s where both rent categories saw increases until 2001 followed by declines up to 2004. The period from 2007 to 2010 shows a marked downturn for both, reflecting a significant economic downturn. Post-2010, both indicators display recovery, indicating a broader economic stabilization phase. While there are periods of divergence, such as the late 1980s and early 1990s when the timing of peaks and troughs varied, the predominant theme is that the rent of primary residence and owners' equivalent rent trends largely mirror each other during key economic phases.
