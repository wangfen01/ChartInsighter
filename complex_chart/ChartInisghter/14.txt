The chart displays the progression of the sex ratio at birth from 1950 to 2023 in the combined regions of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba. Over this extensive period, the data narrates a complex story of cyclical changes in the sex ratio, indicating the number of males born per 100 females in these territories. In the early phase, spanning from 1950 until 1960, the sex ratio begins at moderate levels but witnesses its lowest point in 1960 at 97.47899. Over the next thirty-two years, there is an unmistakable climb, and by 1992, the sex ratio reaches a significant peak at 115.51724. However, this growth is not sustained, and the subsequent eight years show a downward trajectory, bringing the sex ratio to a low of 93.22034 by the end of the millennium.The dawn of the 21st century introduces a period marked by high volatility and an unpredictable pattern, yet the overall direction points upward until 2007, where the sex ratio peaks again at 114.41441. Following this, there is a stark reversal—a pronounced descent over twelve years, bottoming out in 2019 with a sex ratio of 88.61789, the lowest observed in the latter half of the time series.Emerging from the 2019 trough, a swift and erratic rise becomes apparent, pushing the sex ratio to its utmost value of 118.24818 in 2022. This apex, however, proves to be fleeting; the vital statistics for 2022 and 2023 reveal lower variability and a decline, with the sex ratio settling at 111.26761 by 2023.The interaction of trends over the decades underscores a rhythmic pattern characterized by alternating peaks and valleys, presenting an intricate oscillation between periods of growth and decline in the sex ratio. The years that stand out as critical turning points—1992, 2000, 2007, 2019, and 2022—serve to chronicle the ever-shifting demographic landscape of these regions. The overarching narrative woven by these figures reflects the dynamic and changing forces at play in determining the sex ratio at birth in Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba.
