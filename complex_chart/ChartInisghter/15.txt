The chart presents a time-series analysis of rent values for primary residences across different categories within the U.S., covering the period from February 1984 to February 2015.  It is structured as a line graph, delineating significant shifts and patterns in the rental market over this time frame.  Throughout the timeline, multiple key phases can be identified.  Initially, from February 1984 to November 1985, there is a noticeable surge in rent values from 4.5 to 6.7, signaling a robust growth phase.  This period of increase is followed by a downturn lasting until July 1987, where rent values subsided to 3.4.  An upward trend resumed, peaking at 4.5 in September 1990, only to be followed by another downturn that saw values dropping sharply to 1.8 by March 1993.  A persistent recovery emerged post-1993, with rent values steadily climbing to 3.4 by October 1999.  Further elevation occurred, reaching 4.7 by November 2001, before another decline transpired, bottoming out at 2.4 in January 2004.  A significant period of recovery ensued, culminating in a peak of 4.6 in March 2007, only to experience a sharp descent to -0.1 by May 2010.  The subsequent recovery pattern uplifted rents to 2.8 by July 2012, with sustained growth reaching a value of 3.6 by February 2015.
