The chart presents a detailed analysis of the U.S. Owners' Equivalent Rent of Primary Residence, spanning the period from January 1984 to February 2015. The data is showcased as a series of line graphs, each representing different rent types under the category 'symbol'. This visualization aims to illustrate the temporal changes and patterns in equivalent rent values across multiple decades.Throughout this timeframe, the Owners' Equivalent Rent of Primary Residence in the U.S. experienced several notable trends. In the early years, from 1984 to 1986, there was a substantial increase, with rent values peaking at 6.6 in April 1986. This was followed by a downturn until March 1987 when values diminished to 4.2. Another upward phase was observed from March 1987 to January 1988 with a peak at 5.4. The late 1980s and early 1990s witnessed another increase from February 1989 culminating at 6.2 in August 1990, before experiencing a steep drop to 2.8 by August 1991. A significant downward trend was also evident from January 2007 to May 2010, where values dramatically reduced to -0.3. Following this, there was a resurgence in growth from May 2010 to April 2012, peaking at 2.1, and continued stable growth from April 2012 to July 2014, concluding at a value of 2.7.When considering the multi-dimensional aspect of the data, similar patterns of increase followed by decline emerge across various periods, particularly early upward movements like those from January 1984 to April 1986 and March 1987 to January 1988, leading to peaks at different points. Conversely, significant downturns were seen from August 1990 to August 1991 and again from January 2007 to May 2010, marking periods of substantial decline. However, post-2007 displays a unique divergence from previous patterns, with an initial sharp fall followed by a steady climb until 2014. This period breaks earlier cycles characterized by rapid recovery and stabilization, marking a differentiated path of growth and stability.
