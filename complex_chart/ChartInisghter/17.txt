The chart presents a line graph illustrating the trends in the average effective age of retirement for women across various countries, spanning the years 1982 to 2018. The data categorically compares the retirement ages across different nations as indicated by the color coding for each country in the graph legend.Focusing on Cyprus, from 1982 to 1988, the average age at which women retired showed a slight increase, rising to 71.2 years by 1987. Afterward, beginning in 1988, there was a significant decrease in the retirement age that persisted until 1997, hitting its lowest at 59.5 years. Despite ongoing volatility, a general upward trend resumed from 1997 to 2014, peaking notably at 64.4 years in 2001. Following this peak, the data indicates a stabilization around 63.0 years during 2014, before entering a declining phase from 2015 to 2018, ultimately reaching 61.4 years in 2017.Examining the broader trends across multiple dimensions, there is a prevalent pattern among the countries depicted. Initially marked by stability, most of the data highlights an upward movement from 1982 until about 1988. This period was succeeded by heightened volatility between 1988 and 1997, where a downward trend was prominent across the datasets. Post-1997, a reverse shift often occurred, characterized by an upward movement amidst persistent volatility, reaching notable highs around the early 2000s. Such patterns underscore a cyclical nature where periods of relative calm are intermittently disrupted by sharp fluctuations before stabilizing into new trends.
