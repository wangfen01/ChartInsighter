The chart presents a comprehensive analysis of sugar-related economic indicators over a period from 1990 to 2023. It encapsulates two distinct dimensions, described as the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: Sugar and Sweets in U.S. City Average (symbol CN) and the Global price of Sugar, No. 11, World (symbol PB). These data sets are visualized to provide insights into the behavior of sugar prices and consumer price indices over time.For the dimension labeled with symbol CN, from 1990 to 2012, the trend showed high volatility with an overall increase in values, beginning at 100.0 and reaching a high of 175.6 by July 2012. From July 2012 until July 2015, the increase persisted but with decreased volatility, attaining a peak of 177.1, even though there was a slight dip to 169.8 in April 2014. Following this period, from mid-2015 to July 2023, there was a steady rise, peaking at 231.9 by July 2023.In contrast, the data represented by symbol PB indicates a gradual increase from 1990 until the mid-1990s, followed by a decrease from 1999 to a low of 76.5 at the start of 2000. Thereafter, values began recovering until 2006 with a high of 101.5 but decreased to 85.8 by October 2006. Between late 2006 and mid-2011, the trend experienced a significant surge, climaxing in July 2011 at 168.0 before enduring a notable decline to 87.3 in April 2013. From 2013 to early 2017, another rise was observed, ending at 129.4, only to fall to 107.9 by April 2018. The period from 2018 to April 2023 shows robust growth with a high of 179.7.Analyzing the trends across these dimensions reveals both commonalities and differences. Notably, both datasets exhibit long-term growth with marked upward trends from the late 2010s into the early 2020s. During the late 2000s to mid-2011, both dimensions experienced increases with distinct peaks in 2011 and 2012, although their timings differ slightly. From 2015 onwards, one data set (CN) demonstrates smoother growth, whereas the other (PB) displays more fluctuations, characterized by alternating periods of growth and decline. A significant, shared upward trend is noted from 2018 to 2023 across both dimensions, reflecting a period of resilience and consistent growth post-2018, despite earlier volatility.
