The chart presents a detailed examination of the average effective age of retirement for women spanning from 1970 to 2018 across different countries, focusing on Cyprus and the United States. This visual representation provides insights into how retirement ages have fluctuated over nearly five decades.In Cyprus, the retirement age data reveals a pattern of significant fluctuations. The initial notable increase in the average retirement age was observed from 1982 to 1988, reaching a peak of 71.2 years in 1987. This was followed by a sharp decline to 59.5 years by 1997. An upward trend returned between 1997 and 2001, peaking at 64.4 years before another decline ensued, bringing the age down to 59.9 by 2006. A subsequent rise occurred from 2009 to 2014, hitting a high of 63 years, but by 2018, the age had decreased again to 61.4 years.Conversely, in the United States, the trend began with a consistent decline in the average retirement age from 1982, starting at 66.1 years, to a low of 63.1 years in 2002. This downward trend marks a stark contrast to Cyprusâ€™s early fluctuations. From 2002 onward, a steady increase took place, with the retirement age rising to 66.5 years by 2018, surpassing the initial average at the beginning of the recorded period.When comparing these two countries, both demonstrate fluctuations in retirement age over the decades, but the nature and timeline differ significantly. Cyprus experienced more frequent shifts, with several ups and downs, unlike the US, which showed a prolonged decline until early 2000s, followed by a consistent upward trend. Both countries entered a period of increasing retirement ages starting around the early 2000s. However, the United States' increase was steadier and sustained, while Cyprus had a more variable trajectory in the same timeframe.
