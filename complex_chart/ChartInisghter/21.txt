The chart presents a line graph showcasing the historical trends of refugee populations in Algeria and Yemen from 1970 to recent years.  This data provides insights into the dynamics of refugee movements over several decades, capturing the fluctuations in numbers as they relate to changes within these countries.

In examining the refugee trends for Algeria, a distinct pattern emerges where the number of refugees saw a dramatic increase from 1970, starting at 500, and reaching a peak of 219,314 by 1992.  This period marked a substantial growth in Algeria’s refugee population.  However, following this peak, the country experienced a steady decline from 1992 onward, with the refugee count diminishing to 94,094 by 2008.

Yemen's experience with refugee populations is characterized by two major phases of growth, the first beginning in 1977 with numbers rising from a mere 50 to 105,000 by 1986.  This upward trend persisted with a continued increase from 1990, starting from 2,938, and peaking at 270,913 in 2017.  Unlike Algeria’s earlier decline, Yemen's refugee numbers began to decrease after 2017, dropping significantly to 55,568 by 2023.

Comparatively, both Algeria and Yemen showcase parallel yet temporally distinct narratives.  Each country experienced significant increases during their initial growth phases—Algeria from 1970 to 1992, and Yemen from 1990 to 2017.  While both nations eventually saw declines in refugee numbers, Algeria’s downturn from 1992 to 2008 occurred much earlier than Yemen’s, which only began its decrease from 2017 onwards.  This highlights a divergence in timing, with Algeria's peak preceding Yemen's and its decline occurring much sooner, whereas Yemen sustained its growth trajectory for a longer period before experiencing a recent decline.
