The chart presents a comprehensive analysis of sex ratio at birth trends, specifically the number of males per 100 females, in Hong Kong, South Korea, and Vietnam from 1950 to 2023. This time-series analysis compares these regions, emphasizing changes over the decades and highlighting key shifts in trends.In Hong Kong, the sex ratio started at 109.99 in 1950 and initially decreased with low volatility, reaching 103.55 by 1964. A subsequent period of low-volatility increase spanned from 1964 to 2004, peaking locally at 110.47 in 1996. Between 2004 and 2007, the ratio surged to a high of 111.37 with significant fluctuations. Post-2007, a high-volatility decrease ensued, leading to a low of 104.65 by 2020. This trend slightly reversed post-2020, increasing to 107.70 by 2022.South Korea exhibited a minor decrease in the sex ratio from 104.77272 in 1950 to 104.32527 in 1951. It then experienced a rapid increase until reaching a peak of 117.07072 in 1994. Following this peak, a steady decline occurred, bringing the ratio down to 105.1407 by 2014.Vietnam's sex ratio from 1950 to 1989 showed a steady increase, moving from 105.151276 to 105.386055 by 1985. The period from 1989 to 2013 was marked by high volatility yet overall rising trend, culminating at 112.41825 in 2013. Despite notable fluctuations, illustrated by a low point of 104.79692 in 2003, this trend ultimately reversed to a decline between 2013 and 2018. Post-2018, the upward trajectory resumed, reaching 111.480286 by 2021.Upon examining the relationships across these regions, common patterns of increase and decrease in sex ratios appear, albeit with different timings and volatility levels. Both Hong Kong and South Korea notable increases in the late 20th century before subsequent declines, mirroring a common historical uptick in ratios. Vietnam's patterns are aligned in terms of period-spanning increases but diverge with a markedly different post-2018 upturn in contrast to Hong Kong's earlier decline phase which saw a minor rebound post-2020. Overall, these differences highlight parallel yet distinctly timed demographic changes, illustrating both synchronicity and divergence in the sex ratio trends of these countries over the designated timeline.
