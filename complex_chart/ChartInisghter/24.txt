The chart is a line graph that presents the historical trends in fertility rates, measured as the number of children per woman, from 1800 to 2015. It compares such data for Norway and the United Kingdom, providing insights into the demographic changes and childbearing patterns over more than two centuries. The chart highlights fluctuations, peaks, and troughs in fertility rates for each nation over this extensive period.In Norway, the fertility rate was marked by significant volatility in the early 19th century, peaking at 4.39 in 1806 before declining to 3.21 by 1809. Following this period of fluctuation, the rate rose again, reaching 5.05 by 1816. A pronounced downward trend was observed from 1816 until 1839, when the rate reduced to 3.84, followed by an upward trajectory, peaking at 4.93 in 1854. From this point onward, Norway experienced periods of both increasing and decreasing fertility, notable for its high volatility from 1898 to 1935, which eventually led to a sharp decline to 1.78 by 1935. A positive trend was observed from 1935 to 1964, when the fertility rate rose to 2.96. However, this was succeeded by a downward trend until 1983, hitting a low of 1.66. From 1983 onwards, the fertility rate in Norway saw a relatively stable increase, peaking at 1.98 in 2009.The United Kingdom displayed a different pattern. From 1798 to 1801, the fertility rate declined from 5.34 to 4.6. An upswing occurred until 1815, achieving a peak of 6.02. Subsequently, a downward trajectory was observed, lowering the rate to 4.78 by 1831. This declining trend continued until 1847, where the rate reached 4.58, followed by a growth phase until 1859, culminating at 4.97. However, a significant decrease characterized the period from 1868 to 1933, resulting in a fertility rate of 1.72. A slight recovery occurred between 1933 and 1941, ending at 1.84. The post-war period saw substantial growth from 1941 to 1963, with the rate peaking at 2.8. After 1963, a decline ensued until 1979, bringing the rate back to 1.72. From 1979 onward, a gradual increase was observed, peaking at 1.89 in 2010.Comparatively, both nations experienced periods of increasing fertility rates in the early 19th century, with Norway peaking in 1816 and the UK in 1815. A similar pattern of growth was noted from the late 1930s to the mid-1960s, with peaks again closely aligned as Norway reached its apex in 1964 and the UK in 1963. Both countries also showed a gradual uptick in fertility rates from the late 20th century into the early 21st century. However, distinct contrasts emerged early in the 1800s when Norway's fertility rate demonstrated high volatility, unlike the UK's steadier decline and subsequent growth. Additionally, post-1854, Norway's rates fluctuated significantly, while the UK followed a more consistent declining trend until 1933.
