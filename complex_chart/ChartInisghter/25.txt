The chart presents a line graph depicting the birth rates over an extensive timeline across three countries: China, Portugal, and Sweden. This dataset spans various time periods, with China's data beginning in 1949, Portugal's in 1894, and Sweden's starting as early as 1813. It offers an extensive overview of demographic shifts in these regions, highlighting both historical fluctuations and more modern trends.In examining China’s data, there is a clear downward trajectory from 1949 through 1961, reaching a low of 18.0 births per 1,000 people. A remarkable spike occurred between 1961 and 1963, where the birth rate surged to 43.4, followed by a long-term decline extending to 1989, hitting a notable low of 17.5 births per 1,000 in 1984. From 1989 to 2009, China’s birth rate continued its descent, with minimal volatility, reaching just 7.9 births per 1,000 by 1998.Portugal's data reflects high volatility in birth rates from 1894 to 1911, culminating at a peak of 38.6 births per 1,000 in 1911. The subsequent period saw continued volatility but an overall decline, ultimately dropping to 23.8 by 1941. From 1954 through 2009, Portugal witnessed a pronounced decrease in birth rates amid high volatility, reaching a modern low of 9.36 births per 1,000 by 2009.Sweden's birth rate trends capture early growth from 1813 to 1823, peaking at 36.8 births per 1,000, followed by a decline until 1838. This pattern of alternating growth and decline persisted into the late 19th century, with significant downturns peaking in 1933 at 13.7 births per 1,000. Mid-20th-century trends showed a brief increase in the birth rate, reaching 20.6 by 1944, before resuming a long-term decline to 13.7 by 1960. The final phase from the 1960s onward continued this downward trend, culminating in 10.0 births per 1,000 by 1998.Across these dimensions, a common theme emerges: a prolonged decline in birth rates throughout the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st century. All three countries reached significant low points in birth rates around the late 1990s. Notably, China’s unique sharp increase between 1961 and 1963 contrasts with the more stable trends experienced by Portugal and Sweden during this time. Furthermore, while China's trend in recent decades has been characterized by low volatility, Portugal has continued to exhibit high volatility, and Sweden's experience has alternated between periods of volatility and relative stability. These trends highlight both shared global demographic shifts and the distinct historical pathways of each nation.
