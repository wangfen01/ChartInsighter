The chart presents a comparative analysis of the average effective age of retirement in Australia and Latvia over the period from 1994 to 2018. This time-series line graph delineates the changes in retirement age, offering insights into how these trends developed and interacted across the two countries.In Australia, the trend began with a modest decline in the average retirement age, decreasing from 1994 to 1996, where it hit a low of 59.0 years. There was a brief period of stability from 1996 to 1998, during which the retirement age remained constant at 59.0 years. Subsequently, a period of significant volatility ensued, characterized by unpredictable fluctuations that, nonetheless, led to an overall increase, culminating in a retirement age of 64.3 years by 2018.Latvia's retirement age mirrored Australia's decline starting from 1994, decreasing until 1997 from 60.3 to 58.5 years. This was followed by a pattern of fluctuating increases that persisted until 2012, reaching a peak of 64.8 years. However, unlike Australia, Latvia experienced a brief downturn from 2012 to 2015, during which the retirement age fell to 61.0 years. This decline was promptly followed by a resurgence from 2015 to 2018, ending with the retirement age close to its earlier peak at 64.7 years.When comparing the two countries, the early years from 1994 to 1996 saw both Australia and Latvia recording declines in retirement ages. Post this phase, Australia's trend turned stable for a short period and then showed a volatile yet upward journey, while Latvia experienced a consistent increase until 2012. Despite Latvia's distinct decline between 2012 and 2015—contrary to Australia’s continuous upward volatility—both nations exhibited upward trajectories from 2015 to 2018, aligning their retirement ages closely by 2018. These trends highlight a convergence towards similar retirement age levels, despite differing interim patterns and fluctuations.
