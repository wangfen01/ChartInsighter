The chart presents a comparative analysis of government expenditure as a percentage of GDP for Chile and Germany, spanning from 1880 to 2022. This time-series data visualizes how each country's spending as part of their GDP has evolved over more than a century, offering insights into economic decisions and policy impacts.In Chile, government expenditure began increasing from 1880, reaching 14.21% by 1890. The trend continued upward, peaking at 15.54% in 1896. However, from 1896 to 1931, there was a downward trend, with a low of 6.79% in 1918, followed by a rise to 16.55% by 1931. A sharp increase was observed between 1931 and 1972, with expenditures peaking at 34.97% in 1972. This growth was followed by a decline until 1995, bottoming at 18.72%. From 1995 onwards, another upward trend was noted, reaching 33.48% in 2021, before experiencing a decline in 2022, ending at 26.77%.Germany's trajectory was somewhat distinct. Its government expenditure increased from 10.31% in 1880 to a peak of 37.69% in 1913. A decline followed until 1933, with a low of 11.05%. From 1933 to 1975, Germany experienced another increase, reaching its highest level at 50.32%. This was followed by a decrease to 44.29% by 1989, a subsequent rise to 54.86% in 1995, and then a declining trend continued until 2022, with notable reductions observed in 2007, reaching a low of 43.51%.When examining both countries together, similar trends are noted during the period from the early 1930s to the 1970s, where both experienced significant growth, reflecting possibly common global economic influences. Despite this similarity, stark contrasts emerge at different times; while Chile was decreasing in the early 20th century, Germany was on the rise until 1913. In the later years, Chile's expenditure trend increased steadily until 2021, whereas Germany's trend saw ongoing decline post-1995, suggesting varying national responses to economic conditions and policies. These differences underscore the unique economic narratives and policy choices each country faced throughout these periods.
