The chart presents a visual representation of the trends in Consumer Price and Inflation Expectation over the period from January 2017 to February 2021. It distinguishes between the two categories, allowing for a comparative analysis of their respective patterns over time.Consumer Price trends initially exhibit a slight increase from 2.5% to 2.8% between January and February 2017. However, this is followed by a notable decrease to 1.6% by June 2017. From this point onwards, there was a gradual increase reaching 2.9% by July 2018. Subsequently, a downward trend was noticeable, with values decreasing to 1.5% in January 2019. Over the next year, prices rose slowly to 2.5% by January 2020, followed by a sharp decline reaching as low as 0.2% in May 2020. After this trough, there was an incremental rise, culminating at 1.7% by February 2021.In terms of Inflation Expectations, the trend from January 2017 mirrors an initial decline until October 2017, punctuated by a peak in February 2017 at 2.7%. Post-October 2017, there was a steady increase leading up to a local maximum of 3.0% by June 2018. This was immediately followed by a slight decline, moving to 2.9% in July. A prolonged decrease characterized the period from August 2018 to April 2020, with values diminishing amidst high volatility to a low of 2.1% by April 2020. Inflation Expectations then entered an upward trajectory, reaching a peak of 3.3% by February 2021.Comparing the trends across these two dimensions reveals both commonalities and distinct differences. Both dimensions start with a rise in early 2017, encounter a downturn around mid-2018, and witness a notable resurgence beginning in early 2020 through 2021. Despite these overarching similarities, the timing and severity of these fluctuations differ. For instance, the Consumer Price category's sharp drop in early 2020 becomes significant, juxtaposed against the more gradual decline observed in Inflation Expectations. Additionally, while Consumer Prices experience a consistent rise until July 2018, Inflation Expectations peaked earlier in June. These observations highlight both the synchronous and divergent elements within these economic indicators during the specified timeframe.
