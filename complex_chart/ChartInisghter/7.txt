The chart represents a comprehensive analysis of sugar-related economic indices over time, specifically from early 1990 to mid-2024. It features two comparative dimensions: the first is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers covering sugar and sweets in the U.S. City Average, and the second reflects global sugar pricing â€” differentiated into the No. 11 global sugar price and the No. 16 U.S. sugar price indices. The time-series analysis captures significant trends across these indices, exploring key moments of growth and decline over the given period.Focusing on the Consumer Price Index, the data initially dip early in 1990, but soon embark on a growth trajectory that culminates at 100.3 by January 1991. This ascension is interrupted by a downward phase extending until April 1995, bottoming at 91.6. Subsequently, the index ascends again until reaching 93.7 in September 1997. The turn of the century sees further substantial growth between 1998 and 2001, peaking at 96.3 in March. However, a significant downturn occurs thereafter, lowering the index to a nadir of 88.1 by August 2005. From this low, a recovery unfolds, reaching notable highs in January 2020 at 98.2. A brief dip follows, reducing the value, only to see it rise again to 95.9 by January 2022, before it resumes a downward course, terminating at 92.1 by July 2024.The global sugar prices, across No. 11 and No. 16 indices, exhibit a similar oscillatory pattern. Commencing in early 1990, there is an initial minor decline, soon transitioning to an upward movement peaking at 100.1 by January 1991. A general decrease follows, dropping to 99.6 by April 1992, before another growth phase peaks higher by mid-1993. Post-1993, a downward drift occurs, reaching 98.8 by September 1994, quickly ascending thereafter. There are fluctuations during the late 1990s with notable peaks and troughs which give way to a pronounced downfall by December 2005, reaching a low of 89.7. Recovery ensues, gaining strength by February 2009 at 92.0, yet is soon curtailed, leading to another low point in 2010 at 90.8. Post-2017 sees gradual growth until reaching a peak during 2017, followed by another declining trend into 2024. In comparing trends across both economic indices, consistent patterns unfold. Both dimensions reflect an initial decline followed by growth within the early 1990s, and experience significant troughs during the 2001-2005 period. These are mirrored by recoveries from 2010 to 2020. The alignment in these trends indicates a shared sensitivity to broader economic and market conditions, culminating in parallel growth and decline cycles, notably concluding with a downturn towards mid-2024. This detailed analysis underscores predominantly synchronized fluctuations across both indices, despite some variations in specific shorter-term movements.
