The chart provides a line graph that captures the trends in the average effective age of retirement for women, specifically within the OECD context, focusing on Argentina and Brazil over a period from 1982 to 2018. This dataset allows a comparative analysis of how each country's retirement age has evolved through various phases of economic and social change. In Argentina, the average retirement age for women began with a decrease from 70.9 years in 1982 to 67.3 years in 1983. This downward trend continued until 1996, despite a brief uptick to 70.7 years in 1989. The retirement age then saw a rise, peaking at 71.6 years in 2000. Following this peak, a significant decline was observed, with the age dropping to 63.4 years by 2008. From 2008 onward, the retirement age slightly reduced, reaching a low of 63.2 years in 2016, although there was a temporary increase to 65.9 years in 2012. In contrast, Brazil displayed a continual decrease in the average retirement age starting at 72.6 years in 1982, and dropping to 62.8 years by 2000. Post-2000, Brazil experienced a mild rebound with a gradual increase to 65.6 years by 2006. However, between 2006 and 2011, the trend shifted back to a decrease, touching a low of 62.3 years in 2011. From this point until 2018, a slight upward trajectory emerged, peaking at 63.5 years in 2016.The trends reveal shared patterns and divergences between Argentina and Brazil. Both countries predominantly showed a decrease in retirement age from 1982 to around 2000. Argentina’s minor fluctuations contrast with Brazil’s steady decline. In the early 2000s, both countries experienced an upward adjustment, though Argentina's increase halted by 2000, leading to a sharper decline than Brazil's extended growth until 2006. Afterward, while both nations saw a decrease, Brazil's latter years showed a modest rise until 2016, unlike Argentina's continuing decrease after a brief rise in 2012. By 2011 to 2018, both countries converged towards a slow upward trend, showcasing a more aligned pattern despite some deviations in Argentina.
