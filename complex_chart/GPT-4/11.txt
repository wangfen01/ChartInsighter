Analyzing the ratio of inbound to outbound tourist trips for Iceland and Turkey from 1995 to 2022 reveals significant insights into the dynamics of tourism in both countries. Iceland started with a ratio slightly above 1 in 1995, indicating a balanced level of inbound and outbound tourism. This balance saw modest fluctuations until 2008, after which there was a dramatic increase, peaking in 2020 at 3.74. This suggests a substantial growth in inbound tourism compared to outbound, likely influenced by Iceland's increased popularity as a travel destination and strategic marketing efforts.

Turkey's tourism ratio also presents an interesting trend. Starting with a higher ratio than Iceland in 1995 at approximately 1.78, it indicates more inbound than outbound trips. This ratio saw a gradual increase, reflecting Turkey's growing appeal as a global tourist destination. The dramatic spikes in 2007, 2008, and particularly in 2021, where it reached an all-time high of 10.93, coincide with significant investments in tourism infrastructure and regional stability, which temporarily boosted visitor numbers. The drop in subsequent years aligns with global economic downturns and regional instability, affecting the tourist influx to Turkey.

The contrasting trends between the two countries highlight the impact of geopolitical, economic, and social factors on tourism dynamics. Icelandâ€™s steady increase aligns with its rise as a niche destination for nature tourism, while Turkey's fluctuations reflect its broader appeal tempered by external vulnerabilities.
