The sex ratio trends in the British Virgin Islands and Bonaire Sint Eustatius and Saba from 1950 to 2023 demonstrate varied dynamics in demographic developments. In the British Virgin Islands, the sex ratio, indicating males per 100 females, has shown a gradual increase from 1950, starting at 100.83, and stabilizing above 104 in recent years, reaching a peak of 105.26 in 2021 before a slight decrease to 104.37 in 2023. This suggests a consistent male demographic growth relative to females, influenced perhaps by migration trends and birth rates over these decades.

Conversely, Bonaire Sint Eustatius and Saba present a more fluctuating pattern. The ratio began at 102.78 in 1950, peaked notably in 2023 at 118.25, and experienced significant fluctuations throughout the period. Notable peaks such as 115.38 in 1991 and the sharp rise to 118.25 in 2023 suggest specific events or shifts in demographic policies or migration that significantly altered the male-to-female ratio. The dips to levels as low as 88.71 in 2018 followed by rapid increases indicate potential volatility in population dynamics, possibly driven by economic or environmental factors affecting migration or birth rates more dramatically in this smaller region compared to the British Virgin Islands.

These insights reflect how external socio-economic and environmental factors can distinctly impact demographic structures in different but closely located regions.
