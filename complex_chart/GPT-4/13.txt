The line chart illustrates the rent trends for primary residences in the U.S. from 1984 to 2015, capturing data for both "Rent of Primary Residence" and "Owners' Equivalent Rent of Primary Residence." Initially, both rent indices show a generally upward trend, with the "Rent of Primary Residence" increasing from 4.6% in January 1984 to peaks around 4.5% to 4.6% in early 2001. This index shows considerable fluctuations with a notable rise around 2007, reaching up to 4.4%, followed by a decline to 3% in 2009, and a slight recovery thereafter. The "Owners' Equivalent Rent" also exhibits similar trends but with slightly lower values, starting at 4.1% in 1984 and reaching a high of 4.5% by 2002. Post-2008, both indices show a decline, reflecting the impact of the financial crisis on housing costs, with a gradual decrease to around 2.7% by 2015. This comparison indicates a general parallel trend between actual rent and owner-equivalent rent, though the actual rent consistently remains slightly higher throughout the observed period.
