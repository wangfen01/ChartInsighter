The sex ratio trends in Bonaire Sint Eustatius and Saba from 1950 to 2023 illustrate a distinct progression in demographic composition over the years, marked by both stability and volatility. Initially, the ratio remained relatively stable around 102 to 104 males per 100 females during the early years, up until 1958. However, a notable decline began in 1959, dropping to a low of 97.48 by 1960. This decline was short-lived as the ratio rebounded, gradually ascending and reaching a more pronounced increase by the mid-1960s.

A significant peak occurred in 1991, when the sex ratio surged to 115.38, indicating a substantial increase in the male population relative to females. This peak, however, was followed by a period of volatility; the ratio fluctuated noticeably, dipping to a low of 91.94 in 2017—a level reminiscent of the early 1980s—before climbing to a record high of 118.25 in 2022. This recent spike could suggest demographic shifts possibly influenced by migration patterns or changes in birth rates.

By 2023, the ratio slightly adjusted to 111.27, yet still remained significantly higher than the historical average. These fluctuations reflect complex interplays of local conditions, policies, and possibly economic or environmental factors that impact gender composition in this region over the decades.
