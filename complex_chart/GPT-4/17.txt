Analyzing the data chart on the average effective age of retirement for women in Cyprus from 1982 to 2018 shows a distinct trend of declining retirement age over time with notable fluctuations. Initially, the retirement age was consistently high, hovering around 71 years from 1982 until 1988. A significant drop occurred in 1989, when the average retirement age sharply fell to 65.8, initiating a trend of decline that continued into the early 2000s. By 1996, the retirement age had decreased further to 60.4 years, reaching its lowest point in the period analyzed.

Following this period of decline, there was a brief reversal between 1999 and 2002 when the retirement age increased, peaking at 64.4 years in 2001. However, this was short-lived as the trend again shifted, and by 2003 the retirement age began to decrease, stabilizing somewhat around the low 60s in subsequent years. The data from 2006 onwards shows slight oscillations around this level, indicating a period of fluctuation but with no clear upward or downward trend.

This decline in the retirement age from the early 1980s to the late 2010s reflects significant changes, possibly due to evolving economic conditions, pension reforms, or shifts in social norms regarding women's retirement. Such a trend can suggest a shifting landscape in employment and retirement policies that impacts when women choose or are required to retire.
