The chart shows a line graph depicting the number of refugees in Algeria and Yemen over time, from 1970 to 2023. For Algeria, the refugee population remained relatively low at 500 in 1970, but it experienced a dramatic increase starting in 1975, reaching 167,000 by 1981, where it plateaued for several years before slightly rising again in 1992 to 219,314. Afterward, the number of refugees in Algeria declined gradually, reaching around 94,000 by 2005, and this level remained stable through to 2023, with a minor increase to 99,107 in 2022. In contrast, Yemen’s refugee numbers began at a modest 50 in 1977 but saw a sharp spike starting in 1986, when the number surged to over 100,000, peaking at 270,913 in 2017. Following this peak, the refugee population in Yemen experienced a downward trend, dropping to 55,568 by 2023, with significant declines after 2019.

Both countries show distinct patterns. Algeria’s refugee population, after the initial surge in the 1970s and 1980s, became relatively stable for several decades, with only minor fluctuations in the later years. Yemen’s refugee population, however, exhibits a more volatile trend, with rapid growth during the late 1980s to the 2000s, followed by a sharp decline from 2019 onward. While the number of refugees in Algeria remained consistently lower than in Yemen, the trend in Yemen is more reflective of a turbulent political and humanitarian environment, especially in the 2010s. The comparison reveals a stark contrast in the refugee dynamics, with Yemen experiencing larger fluctuations and a peak that far exceeded Algeria’s numbers.
