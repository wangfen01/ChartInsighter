The chart displays the sex ratio at birth in Hong Kong, South Korea, and Vietnam from 1950 to 2023, measured as the number of males per 100 females at birth. In Hong Kong, the sex ratio initially started high, at approximately 109.99 in 1950, before gradually declining over the next few decades, reaching a low of around 104.65 in 2020. After 2020, the ratio showed a slight increase, reaching approximately 107.70 in 2023. South Korea exhibited a similar decline, starting at around 104.77 in 1950 and peaking in the late 1980s to early 1990s, with values above 114 males per 100 females, before starting a steady decline from the mid-1990s. By 2023, the ratio had dropped to 105.75. Vietnam, on the other hand, showed a more stable trend with minimal fluctuations over the years. Beginning at about 105.15 in 1950, the sex ratio in Vietnam remained relatively stable, gradually increasing over the decades and peaking at 112.42 in 2013, before declining slightly to around 110.48 in 2023.

Looking at the trends across the three regions, Hong Kong and South Korea both show significant fluctuations in the sex ratio, with South Korea experiencing a sharp rise and fall in the 1990s, while Hong Kong's ratio gradually decreased throughout the period. In contrast, Vietnam's sex ratio remained relatively stable, with a gradual increase until the early 2000s, followed by a decline towards the most recent years. South Korea consistently had the highest sex ratio at birth during the 1990s, while Hong Kong had the lowest ratio from the 2000s onward. Although there were some similarities in the overall direction of trends, each regionâ€™s trajectory was unique, with Vietnam showing the least volatility, while both Hong Kong and South Korea experienced notable fluctuations in their sex ratios at birth over the decades.
