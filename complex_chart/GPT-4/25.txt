The chart shows a line graph of birth rates over time in China, Portugal, and Sweden from 1949 to 1961. In China, the birth rate started at 36 births per 1,000 people in 1949, gradually decreasing to a low of 18 births per 1,000 people by 1961. This period saw a significant decline, especially between 1959 and 1960, when the birth rate dropped sharply from 24.8 to 20.9. The trend in China was primarily downward, with a slight recovery starting from 1962, when the rate increased to 37.0, before stabilizing and fluctuating in the mid-30s in the following years.
In contrast, Portugal's birth rate showed a more stable trend during the same period. Starting at 25.5 in 1949, it experienced minor fluctuations and remained relatively consistent, hovering around 24 to 25 births per 1,000 people in the early 1950s. A slight decline occurred starting in the mid-1950s, with the birth rate dropping to 22.9 in 1965 and continuing to decrease to 19.1 by 1976. Throughout the period, Portugal's birth rate was notably higher than China's, reflecting a more gradual decline compared to China's sharp drop.
Sweden’s birth rate was also relatively stable, though it started higher than both China and Portugal. The rate was 29.7 in 1813 and fluctuated in the 20s and 30s throughout the early decades, dipping to 24.7 in 1910. Like Portugal, Sweden's birth rate saw minor declines over the years but did not experience the sharp fluctuations observed in China. By the 1960s, the Swedish birth rate had decreased to around 14 births per 1,000 people.
Overall, the trends between the three countries reveal stark differences. While China’s birth rate saw a steep and dramatic decline during the early 1960s, Portugal and Sweden experienced relatively stable decreases. China’s birth rate was consistently higher than those of Portugal and Sweden in the earlier years, but the gap narrowed significantly by the end of the period.
