The trends in the average effective age of retirement in Australia and Latvia from 1994 to 2018 reveal distinct trajectories reflective of each country's retirement policies and economic conditions. In Australia, the retirement age shows a gradual increase over the studied period, beginning at 59.2 in 1994 and steadily rising to 64.3 by 2018. This upward trend suggests a policy shift aimed at extending working lives, possibly in response to aging population dynamics and the sustainability of pension systems.

Conversely, Latvia displays more variability in its retirement age trends. Starting at 60.3 in 1994, the average retirement age in Latvia fluctuates significantly in the initial years, dropping to a low of 58.5 in 1997 before rising again. Notably, there is a sharp increase from 59.5 in 2002 to 63 in 2002, followed by a period of stability and another rise in later years, peaking at 64.7 in 2018. These fluctuations and the overall upward trend might be influenced by economic transitions, post-Soviet economic reforms, and changes in social policies affecting labor markets and social security systems.

The differences in these patterns between Australia and Latvia could reflect their respective economic developments, demographic pressures, and governmental responses to social welfare needs. The steadily increasing retirement age in Australia contrasts with the more erratic pattern in Latvia, indicating different strategies in managing workforce participation and retirement planning. This analysis not only underscores the changes in retirement ages but also suggests a broader context of policy evolution and demographic shifts in each country over the quarter-century.
