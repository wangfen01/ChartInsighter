Analyzing the government expenditure as a percentage of GDP for Chile and Germany from the late 19th century to the present reveals significant trends and fluctuations that reflect each country's economic and political history. In Chile, the government expenditure percentage began at 8.42% of GDP in 1880, experiencing fluctuations with a notable increase during periods of economic or political transition. For instance, expenditure peaked at 34.97% in 1972 during a period of intense political and social reform, followed by a notable decrease in the late 1970s and stabilization in subsequent decades. The recent years show a sharp increase to 33.48% in 2021, possibly reflecting fiscal responses to economic challenges.

Germany's expenditure trends show a different pattern, beginning at 10.31% in 1880 and displaying a more pronounced fluctuation during the two World Wars and the interwar period. Notably, expenditure surged to a historical high of 50.32% in 1975, likely due to economic strategies responding to the oil crisis and post-war reconstruction efforts. The post-reunification era shows a gradual normalization, with a recent rise to 50.94% in 2021, indicative of increased fiscal activity possibly linked to economic stimuli in response to global economic pressures.

These expenditure trends are crucial for understanding the fiscal policies of Chile and Germany, highlighting how government spending has evolved in response to both internal developments and external economic forces. The analysis suggests a complex interplay between government spending and broader economic conditions, where political history, global crises, and economic policies have significantly shaped fiscal behavior over more than a century.
