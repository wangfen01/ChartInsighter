Analyzing the trends in inflation and inflation expectations from 2017 to 2021 provides insights into economic stability and consumer sentiment. In the category of Consumer Prices, inflation begins at 2.5% in January 2017, exhibiting fluctuations throughout the year but generally trending downwards to reach 1.6% in June 2017. This decrease in consumer price inflation could indicate a period of economic stability or effective monetary policy. However, inflation rates see a slight increase again towards the end of 2017, stabilizing around 2.1% to 2.3% in December. The trend continues into 2018 and 2019 with minor fluctuations, showing a relatively stable consumer price landscape.

Inflation expectations, recorded separately, start at 2.6% in January 2017 and generally align closely with actual inflation rates, although they are consistently slightly higher. This suggests that consumers might have anticipated higher inflation than actually materialized, possibly influenced by economic news or fiscal policies. The expectation peaks at 3% several times throughout 2018 and 2020, notably in June 2018 and August 2020, indicating moments when consumers expected inflationary pressures to intensify, possibly due to external economic factors or market uncertainties.

The year 2020 shows a significant dip in April and May for actual inflation, with rates falling to 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, likely due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced deflationary pressures through decreased demand and lower consumer spending. However, inflation expectations did not dip as significantly, suggesting that consumers anticipated a rebound or were influenced by the potential for economic stimulus measures.

By 2021, both actual inflation and inflation expectations rise, reaching 1.7% and 3.3%, respectively, by February. This increase could be due to economic recovery efforts, fiscal stimuli, and possibly pent-up consumer demand affecting price levels.

This analysis underscores the interplay between observed inflation and consumer expectations, which can be critical for policymakers in gauging economic sentiment and preparing appropriate fiscal and monetary responses to maintain economic stability and confidence.
