Analyzing the multi-dimensional data for symbols PAYEMS and CANA from 1990 to 2024 reveals distinct trends and interrelations. The values for PAYEMS generally fluctuate and exhibit a noticeable downward trend towards the latter years, dipping significantly during periods of economic downturn such as the early 2000s and 2020. For CANA, the values remain relatively stable with minor fluctuations but also trend downwards post-2020, mirroring the trajectory seen in PAYEMS.
Comparatively, CANA values tend to be slightly higher than PAYEMS at numerous points throughout the timeline, indicating possible regional or sector-specific economic variances. Both symbols show a recovery phase post-recession periods but the recovery is often not strong enough to return to previous peaks, particularly visible in the drastic falls around 2020 followed by a slow recovery. This synchronous fall and staggered recovery pattern underline a correlated impact of global economic events on both datasets, highlighting not only their mutual dependence but also their vulnerability to broader economic shifts.
