Examining the retirement age trends in Argentina and Brazil reveals distinct patterns and shifts over the years, reflecting the economic and policy landscapes of each country. From 1982 to 2018, Argentina's average effective retirement age for women exhibited significant fluctuations. Initially, the retirement age started high at 70.9 in 1982, showing variability throughout the 1980s and early 90s, reaching a peak of 71.6 in 2000. The following years saw a general trend of decrease, dipping to 63.2 in 2016 before a slight recovery to 64.3 by 2018.

Brazil, starting from 72.6 in 1982, demonstrated a more pronounced downward trend across the same period. The retirement age gradually decreased, stabilizing somewhat in the mid-60s during the 2000s. The lowest point occurred in 2012 at 62.3, with minor fluctuations following but generally maintaining a lower retirement age compared to earlier decades.

These trends may be indicative of varying social policies, economic conditions, and shifts in societal norms regarding retirement. Both countries show a clear tendency towards lower retirement ages over the years, possibly due to changes in pension schemes, labor market conditions, or broader demographic shifts. This analysis underscores the dynamic nature of work and retirement across different cultural and economic contexts, providing insights into how societal factors influence retirement decisions.
