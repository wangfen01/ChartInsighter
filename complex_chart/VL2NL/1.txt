This visualization is a line chart that displays the value of different symbols over time. The data is plotted on a temporal x-axis labeled 'Observation Date' and a quantitative y-axis labeled 'Value'. Each line represents a unique symbol, distinguished by color, with the legend title 'Symbol'. The chart is designed with a width of 800 pixels and a height of 400 pixels. No interactive features like tooltips are mentioned in the description. The visualization likely depicts the fluctuation of values for three different symbols (CN, PB, PN) over a certain period, highlighting that CN experienced the highest overall increase in value of 131.9, while PN had the lowest average value at 90.44. Additionally, the maximum value recorded across all symbols was 231.9, and the minimum was 36.3, indicating a wide range of values during the observed period.
