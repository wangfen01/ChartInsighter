This visualization is a line chart that displays the change in 'Value' over time, with the x-axis representing the 'Observation Date' and the y-axis representing the 'Value'. Different lines on the chart are colored based on the 'Symbol' field, which categorizes the data into different symbols, such as 'CN'(Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: Sugar and Sweets in U.S. City Average) and 'PN'(Global price of Sugar, No. 16, U.S.). The chart is designed with a width of 800 pixels and a height of 400 pixels, and it includes interactive tooltips. The data for this chart is loaded from a CSV file named 'data.csv'. The visualization likely displays the fluctuation of values for symbols 'CN' and 'PN' over time, highlighting that 'CN' has a higher maximum, minimum, and average value compared to 'PN'. It also shows a greater overall change in value for 'CN' (131.9) than for 'PN' (69.3) throughout the observation period.
