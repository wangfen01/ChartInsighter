The visualization is a line chart titled "Fertility Rate: Children per Woman, 1816 to 2015". It displays data from a CSV file, plotting the fertility rate (measured in children per woman) over time from 1816 to 2015. Each line represents a different country, with the 'Year' on the x-axis and the 'Fertility rate (Gapminder, v12, 2017)' on the y-axis. The countries are distinguished by color, and the chart provides interactive tooltips that show the country name, year, and fertility rate when a user hovers over the lines.The visualization likely illustrates a comparison of fertility rates between Japan and the United Kingdom over time, highlighting the UK's peak fertility rate of 5.73 children per woman as the maximum and Japan's low of 1.3 children per woman as the minimum. It also shows a significant decline in Japan's fertility rate from 4.45 in 1816 to 1.44 in 2015, indicating a downward trend, while the average fertility rate across all countries remains at about 3.45 children per woman.
