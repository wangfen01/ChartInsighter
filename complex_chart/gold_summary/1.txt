The chart illustrates the trends of CN, PN, and PB represented by three line graphs over time.    Over the years, CN demonstrates a general upward trend,  rising from 100.0 in 1990 to 231.9 in 2023.    In contrast, PN exhibits significant fluctuations, starting at 100.0 in 1990, initially declining and reaching a local peak in 1995, followed by a drop to its lowest point of 39.0 in 1999.    It then undergoes fluctuations but shows an overall upward trend, peaking at 192.4 in 2011, then dropping again until 2015, and then fluctuating continuously to settle at 169.3 in 2023.    PB shows moderate fluctuations, with minimal initial variations, reaching a local peak after 2010, declining until 2013, and then shifting to an upward trend, reaching 175.1 in 2023.    While CN continues to rise, PN and PB exhibit fluctuating characteristics.    CN remains mostly in the lead, but around 2012, it was overtaken by PB.    Subsequently, PB declined, and CN regained and maintained its leading position.
