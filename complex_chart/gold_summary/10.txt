This chart illustrates the trend of government spending as a percentage of GDP in Austria and the United States from 1875 to 2022.      Over this 142-year span, the government spending ratios in the two countries exhibit significant differences and distinct trends.     First, looking at the data from Austria, in 1880, Austria's government spending as a percentage of GDP was 11.36%, which was significantly higher than the United States' 2.24% at the time.      Entering the early 20th century, the volatility of Austria's government spending increased gradually, reaching a local peak of 22.23% in 1909.      During World War II, data recovery in 1948 showed Austria's government spending jumping to 32.75% of GDP. After 1956, the proportion decreased but began to rise again from the 1950s onward, reaching a peak of 54.53% in 1987.      In recent years, Austria's government spending ratio has remained between 50% and 52%, but due to the impact of COVID-19, it rose to 56.78% in 2020 before slightly decreasing to 52.80% in 2022.     Meanwhile, in the United States, government spending as a percentage of GDP was relatively stable in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, hovering around 2% to 3%.      During World War I, this proportion rose sharply to 18.97% in 1918 and peaked at 44.08% in 1945 during World War II.    From the 1960s onward, the United States' government spending ratio stabilized, ranging between 27% and 37%.      In 2020, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ratio increased to 44.82% before slightly declining to 36.26% in 2022.     Finally, comparing the data from the two countries, Austria's government spending as a percentage of GDP has generally been higher than that of the United States for most of the period.      However, during major historical events, such as world wars and economic crises, the government spending ratios in both countries increased significantly.      Additionally, in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, both countries experienced a sharp rise in government spending as a percentage of GDP.
