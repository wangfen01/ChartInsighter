This chart shows the evolution of the inbound to outbound tourism ratio in Iceland and Turkey. Iceland's ratio started at 1.14 in 1995 and remained relatively stable around the early 2000s, with most years being slightly above 1 which represented a balance between inbound and outbound. However, starting in 2006, Iceland experienced a significant increase in inbound tourism. The ratio rose sharply from 0.96 in 2006 to 1.91 in 2009 and has continued to climb since 2010 after a little dip. By 2017, Iceland reached a peak of 3.59, meaning that there were 3.59 times as many inbound tourists as outbound tourists. Despite a slight fluctuation in 2020 due to the global epidemic (reaching a high of 3.74), the overall trend has remained upward. in 2021, the ratio declined slightly to 3.19, but it is still well above the levels of the late 1990s and early 2000s. In contrast, Turkey's ratio has been more volatile and at a higher overall level. in 1995, Turkey's ratio was 1.78, about 0.64 higher than Iceland's during the same period. Turkey's ratio rose slightly in the early 2000s, from 1.45 in 1999 to 2.46 in 2005. However, there was a notable jump in 2006, when the ratio jumped to 6.09 in 2008 from 2.29. Since then, Turkey's ratio has continued to fluctuate upwards, although saw a big fall in 2016. It peaked at a staggering 10.93 in 2021, a value that is more than 3.4 times that of Iceland's ratio (3.19) in the same year. Notably, Turkey's rate fell back to 6.94 in 2022 but remains much higher than Iceland's. Overall, both countries show a trend of growth in inbound travel relative to outbound travel, but Turkey's growth is more dramatic and volatile. Iceland's growth has been relatively flat, accelerating from 2006, while Turkey experienced a large jump in 2007 and has continued to fluctuate upward since.
