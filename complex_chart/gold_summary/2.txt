This chart illustrates the changes in the sex ratio at birth in Barbados and the United States from 1950 to 2023, highlighting significant differences in data trends between the two countries.   Over this 73-year observation period, the sex ratio at birth in Barbados experienced considerable fluctuations.   Starting in 1950, the sex ratio gradually increased, then decreased during the 1980s, followed by an upward trend, reaching 103.41 in 1990.   Subsequently, Barbados' sex ratio exhibited even greater fluctuations but showed an overall upward trend, reaching the highest point of the observation period in 2008.   Afterward, it began to decline and stabilized, falling to 103.30 by 2023.  In contrast, the sex ratio at birth in the United States showed relatively minor fluctuations.   Starting in 1950, the initial value was significantly higher than that of Barbados.   However, in the mid-1950s, the U.S. sex ratio experienced a noticeable decline, reaching its lowest point of 101.74 in 1956.   Following this, the ratio began to recover and remained relatively stable, mostly ranging between 104 and 105.   Notably, Barbados' sex ratio at birth peaked in 2008, surpassing that of the United States, but then quickly declined to fall below the U.S. level.   By 2023, the sex ratio at birth in the United States stood at 104.75, remaining higher than that of Barbados.
