This line graph illustrates the trends in fertility rates, measured as children per woman, in Japan and the UK from 1816 to 2015. In Japan, the fertility rate began at 4.45 in 1816, gradually increased, reaching 4.84 in 1863, then sharply declined after 1864 to 3.7 by 1871. It fluctuated and rebounded to around 4-5 by the mid-20th century, followed by a fluctuating decline, dropping to 1.32 by 2000. In recent years, Japan's fertility rate has stabilized at around 1.3 to 1.4. In the UK, the fertility rate started at 5.73 in 1816, fluctuated downward during the early 19th century, and then stabilized during the mid-19th century. It exhibited a steady decline from the late 19th century to the 1920s, rebounded to 3.08 in 1920, then continued to decline and rebound, eventually stabilizing between 1.8 and 1.9. Overall, both countries have shown fluctuating declining trends, but Japan experienced a more abrupt decline from the mid-20th century. By the beginning of the 21st century, the fertility rates of the two countries have converged, though Japan's rate remains slightly lower than that of the UK.
