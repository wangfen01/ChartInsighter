This chart illustrates the trends in fertility rates, measured as children per woman, in Norway and the UK from 1800 to 2015. In Norway, the fertility rate began at 4.32 in 1800, and experienced fluctuations and a rise during the early 19th century, peaking at 5.05 in 1816. Afterward, it generally fluctuated around 4.5 throughout the late 19th century, followed by a downward trend. Entering the 20th century, Norway's fertility rate continued to decline, falling from 4.4 in 1900 to 2.5 by 1970, then stabilizing in the 1980s, and reaching 1.84 in 2015, generally maintaining between 1.7 and 2.0. In the UK, the fertility rate was 5.34 in 1798, rising to 6.02 by 1815, then began a significant decline to 4.78 by 1831, fluctuating between 4.8 and 5.0 thereafter, continuing to decrease to 2.03 by 1918, and after some fluctuations, stabilized at 1.88 by 2015. Overall, both Norway and the UK have shown a declining trend in fertility rates since the 19th century. The UK had a higher fertility rate than Norway in the early 19th century, but both countries converged to similar, lower levels of fertility rates by the latter half of the 20th century.
