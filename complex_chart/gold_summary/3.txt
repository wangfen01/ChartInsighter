This chart illustrates the changes in the average actual retirement age for women in Australia and Latvia from 1994 to 2018. During this period, the retirement age in both countries showed an overall upward trend, but their specific patterns of change differed significantly. The retirement age in Australia changed relatively smoothly, exhibiting a stable upward trend. In contrast, Latvia's retirement age experienced much more dramatic changes, rising rapidly from the beginning of the 21st century until 2002, then declining sharply until 2005, rising again quickly until 2012, followed by another sharp decline until 2015, and finally resuming an upward trend.Notably, around 2002 and 2012, Latvia's retirement age was significantly higher than Australia's, reaching 63 years and 64.8 years, respectively, while Australia's retirement age during the same periods was 60.5 years and 62.7 years. However, between 2013 and 2017, Latvia's retirement age fell below that of Australia. By 2018, the retirement ages of the two countries were close again, with Latvia slightly higher than Australia (64.7 years compared to 64.3 years).
