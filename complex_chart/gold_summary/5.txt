This chart illustrates the changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and inflation expectations from January 2017 to early 2021.     From January 2017 to 2019, inflation expectations fluctuated between 2.0% and 3.0%, with most values ranging from 2.6% to 2.7%, showing relative stability.     In 2020, due to the impact of COVID-19, inflation expectations experienced significant changes.     In January 2020, inflation expectations were at 2.5%, but they plummeted to 2.1% in April.   They then gradually recovered, reaching 3.3% by January 2021.    In contrast, the actual CPI during this period showed greater volatility.     It initially declined until June 2017, then rose to approximately 2.8% in July 2018, the highest point, before dropping again to 1.5% in January 2019.     Subsequently, it remained stable but showed an upward trend, reaching 2.5% by January 2020.     Afterward, it dropped sharply to its lowest point in June 2020 and then began to rise again.     Throughout the observation period, the actual CPI was generally lower than inflation expectations, with the gap widening significantly in 2020.
