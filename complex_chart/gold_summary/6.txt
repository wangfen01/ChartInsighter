This chart illustrates the changes in the average effective retirement age for women in Argentina, Brazil, and Germany from 1982 to 2018.      The data show significant differences and varying trends among the three countries over the 36-year period.      The trends in Argentina and Brazil exhibit some similarities, with both showing an overall decline, though with different patterns.      In Argentina, the retirement age initially declined until 1983, then rose to a local peak of 70.7 years in 1989.      This was followed by fluctuations, a decline until 1996, then a rise to the highest peak of the 2000s at 71.6 years.      It subsequently declined to its lowest point in 2008 (63.4 years) before continuing to fluctuate, while overall remaining stable.     In Brazil, the retirement age also initially showed a declining trend, with the most significant drop occurring in the early 1990s, from 72.6 years in 1982 to 63.6 years in 1993.      Afterward, the retirement age fluctuated but remained relatively stable overall.      The trend in Germany, however, was entirely different from the other two countries.      Before the mid-1990s, Germany's retirement age remained relatively stable at around 60 years.      It then began to increase slowly but steadily, with the most significant growth occurring between 2009 and 2016, when the retirement age rose from 60.5 years to 63.2 years.      By the end of 2018, the retirement ages in the three countries were gradually converging: 64.3 years in Argentina, 63.3 years in Brazil, and 63.6 years in Germany.
