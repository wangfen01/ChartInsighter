This chart illustrates the changes in the nonfarm payroll employment index from 1990 through July 2024 for the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward Metropolitan Statistical Area (PAYEMS) and California (CANA).       The two curves represent employment trends for these two regions.      First, the employment index for PAYEMS showed an upward trend in the early 1990s, peaking at over 100 in 1991, before undergoing a significant decline, reaching approximately 91 by mid-1994.       From 1994 to 2000, the region experienced a strong round of job growth, with the index rising from 91.6 to around 96.       However, in 2001, PAYEMS employment was severely impacted, with the index sharply dropping to about 87 in 2011.       Subsequently, the San Francisco area entered a phase of sustained recovery, peaking at 98.2 in 2020.       After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the employment index for PAYEMS plummeted to 92.7, then rebounded but began declining again in mid-2022, reaching 92.1 as of July 2024.      Meanwhile, CANA's overall employment index remained around 100 in the early 1990s.       Employment growth in California as a whole was relatively steady.       After the bursting of the internet bubble in 2001, CANA's employment index declined sharply, bottoming out at approximately 90.       From 2006 to 2019, California's employment also recovered steadily and reached a level of 96.9 by late 2019.       Following the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, California's overall employment index fell to 94.8, then slightly recovered before starting to decline again in mid-2022.       As of July 2024, its index stood at 92.7.
