This chart illustrates the trend of government spending as a percentage of GDP in the United Kingdom and the United States from 1875 to 2022.        It highlights the historical trends in government spending for both countries and reflects the impact of major historical events on fiscal policies.        In the mid-19th century, the United Kingdom maintained government spending at around 7% of GDP, while the United States had an even lower ratio during the same period, mostly below 4%.       Entering the 20th century, government spending in both countries increased significantly, especially during the two World Wars.        During World War I, the United Kingdom's government spending rose sharply from 8.17% in 1913 to 68.42% in 1916.        In the United States, after its entry into World War I, government spending increased from 1.60% in 1916 to 24.15% in 1919.        During World War II, government spending in both countries rose dramatically again, with the United Kingdom’s share increasing from 20.31% in 1939 to 66.90% in 1945, and the United States’ share rising from 8.94% in 1940 to 44.08% in 1945.        After the wars, government spending in both countries declined significantly, returning to more normal levels.       Following World War II, both countries exhibited an overall upward trend in government spending, which stabilized after 1950.        In the United Kingdom, government spending remained largely between 40% and 50% of GDP from the 1950s to the 1970s, while in the United States, it ranged from 30% to 35%.        Starting in the 1980s, the United Kingdom’s government spending gradually declined, dropping from 50.75% in 1982 to 38.54% in 2019.        In contrast, the United States’ government spending remained relatively stable during this period, typically ranging between 35% and 38%.       In 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 led to a significant increase in government spending in both countries.        The United Kingdom’s spending jumped from 38.54% in 2019 to 49.87% in 2020, while the United States’ spending rose from 35.97% in 2019 to 44.82% in 2020, followed by a subsequent decline.       Overall, the United Kingdom typically had a higher share of government spending as a percentage of GDP than the United States.        Both countries saw significant increases in government spending during major historical events, such as world wars and economic crises.  The COVID-19 pandemic once again highlighted the tendency of both governments to increase spending in the face of major challenges.
