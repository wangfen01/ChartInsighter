It covers a period from early 2002 to early 2014, showcasing fluctuations in financial yields across these two dimensions.Initially, the data for Moody's Seasoned Baa Corporate Bond Yield (trend0) shows a downtrend from October 2002, reaching a local minimum in May 2004 at 0.71%. An upward movement follows, peaking at 0.97% in November 2005, though this is succeeded by a decline to 0.96% in April 2010. After some minor upward movement in mid-2010, a downward trend persists, reaching 0.76% by June 2011. It peaks again in July 2012 at 1.47% before falling to 0.65% in February 2014, with a general decline marking the end of the period.Conversely, the 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average (trend1) begins with a decrease from April 2002, dropping to 0.50477% by July 2003, followed by fluctuations, reaching 0.87179% in September 2003, before descending again. From March 2004 through February 2006, the data demonstrates volatility, culminating at a peak of 1.67829%. After a temporary increase in November 2007 to 1.688%, a decline is noted, but from February 2008 to December 2008, there is a marked surge to 2.416%. A sharp decrease to 0.32272% by March 2010 follows, with a brief recovery to 0.62432% in August 2010 before another drop. Afterward, a volatile increase peaks in November 2011 at 0.977%, declines by January 2013 to 0.33352%, then ultimately climbs steadily to 0.81988% by April 2014.In relationship to each other, both series display a similar initial decline from early 2002 into mid-2004, followed by varying recovery periods. A significant similarity is the sharp increase around 2008, peaking by the end of the year, and then both trend into considerable declines by early 2010. Post-2010, diverging behaviors are observed: the 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average (trend1) exhibits higher volatility with an eventual upward trend leading into 2014, while Moody's Baa Corporate Bond Yield (trend0) presents a smoother oscillation with an ultimate downward trend, marking a contrasting trajectory.
