The chart in question presents a line graph showcasing the sex ratio at birth over time in Armenia and Bermuda, spanning from the year 1950 to 2023. The sex ratio is measured numerically as the number of males per 100 females born each year. The visualization color-codes data by country to differentiate the trends for Armenia and Bermuda over the recorded period. In Armenia, the sex ratio began with a moderate increase from 1950 until 1985, hitting a high in 1983 at 105.45 males per 100 females and encountering the lowest point of 102.47 in 1977. A pronounced period of fluctuations ensued, surging to a dramatic peak in 2002 at 116.92, starkly elevated from the measure in 1985 of 103.94. Following this apex, the trend shifted to a marked decline, dropping by over 10 males per 100 females to 106.19 in 2021. This decline was interrupted by a minor upturn, leading to a sex ratio of 108.47 by 2023.Bermuda's sex ratio trajectory began with an ascending trend from 1950 until the end of the 1960s, reaching 109.72851 at its highest in 1969. This period of growth reversed briefly, dipping to 103.08057 in 1973, followed by a decade marked by high volatility and another peak in 1979 at 111.74785. The subsequent years showcased continuous variability with the sex ratio fluctuating, particularly declining to a trough in 1984 at 103.25. By contrast, a resurgence in the growth of the sex ratio emerged, persisting until 1999. The next decade was characterized by a pronounced spike in the sex ratio, with it reaching 113.793106 in 2009. From there, Bermuda's sex ratio experienced a high volatility downtrend until 2014. The pattern stabilized somewhat, but the sex ratio continued to decrease, peaking again in 2016 and then falling off toward the end of the timeframe.Comparing both countries' sex ratios over time reveals intricate patterns of interaction. Notably, periods of intense fluctuation in both Armenia and Bermuda during the 1970s and into the 1980s exhibit a similar volatility in sex ratios. Critical peaks occur in the early 2000s, with Armenia's highest at 2002 and Bermuda following suit in 2009. A distinct contrast emerges in the trends after these peaks; while Armenia exhibits a relatively consistent downward trend until 2021, Bermuda's trajectory is characterized by erratic fluctuations, including a notable peak in 2016. Despite diverging in specific trends post-2009, both countries ultimately exemplify a degree of decline in sex ratios towards the end of the recorded period.
