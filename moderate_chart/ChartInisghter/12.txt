The chart presents a line graph featuring the sex ratio at birth in both Armenia and China spanning over seven decades from 1950 to 2023. Armenia's pattern initially displayed a modest increase in the sex ratio, starting from a lower baseline relative to later years, until a steady climb led to a peak in 1983 with 105.45 males per 100 femalesâ€”up from 102.47 in 1977. In the subsequent years, the rise became more pronounced as the ratio surged to 116.92 by 2002, signaling a significant demographic shift. Post-2002, the ratio experienced a general decline, although it should be noted that this decline was not uninterrupted, given the slight uptick observed from 2021, ascending from 106.19 to 108.47 by 2023.In contrast, China's sex ratio maintained a fairly stable level during the very early years but entered a phase of high variability that eventually transitioned into a more pronounced upward trajectory, hitting an all-time high of 117.48244 males per 100 females in 2006. However, unlike Armenia, after reaching its zenith, China's sex ratio underwent a continuous and unyielding descent over the next 16 years, settling at 110.41473 by 2022.When the trends of Armenia and China are juxtaposed, it is evident that both countries saw their sex ratios climb until reaching peak levels in the early 21st century, with Armenia's peak preceding China's by four years. Despite this commonality, the trends diverge considerably after the peaks. China's decline was persistent and devoid of notable fluctuations, highlighting a persistent normalization of the sex ratio. Armenia, on the other hand, encountered a fluctuating decline that was punctuated by a recent, albeit mild, recovery in the sex ratio. Such contrasting post-peak movements reflect divergent underlying factors, which might be rooted in unique social developments or the impact of policy measures specific to each country.
