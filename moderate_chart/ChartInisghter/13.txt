The chart showcases a line graph that captures the trends in phosphate fertilizer use per area of cropland over time, spanning from 1961 to 2021. It highlights the changes in phosphate nutrient levels for two distinct countries, Myanmar and Iceland, allowing for a comparison of trends across these regions.In Myanmar, the trend in phosphate nutrient levels reflects several distinct phases. Beginning in 1961, there was a steady increase, reaching 1.48 by 1971, and continuing to rise to 4.88 by 1986. This growth phase was followed by a period of decline, reducing the levels to 1.09 by 1992. However, starting in 1992, a significant upswing occurred, peaking at 5.66 in 1995. Subsequently, another downturn ensued, bringing the level as low as 0.4 by 2009. Notably, from this low point, there was a pronounced rise culminating in the highest recorded level of 14.48 by 2019, although a downward trend followed, with levels dropping to 3.53 by 2021.In contrast, Iceland's phosphate trends from 1961 to 1982 showed a consistent upward trajectory, reaching a peak at 67.16 in 1982. This was followed by a long-term decline until 2003, with the lowest point being 26.12 in 1996. The period between 2003 to 2014 was marked by volatility but ultimately resulted in another peak at 73.32 in 2014. However, after 2014, Iceland experienced a significant drop in phosphate levels, reaching as low as 12.25 by 2019.Comparatively, both Myanmar and Iceland exhibited an initial phase of growth in phosphate levels from 1961 to the early 1980s, indicating a synchronized start in their nutrient application trends. However, divergences became prominent in the mid-1980s to mid-1990s, with Myanmar showing a pattern of decline followed by a rise, contrasting with Iceland's continuous decline during the same period. Furthermore, while Iceland faced a steep decline after 2014, Myanmar showed an increase, peaking in 2019 before a subsequent decrease. These contrasting trends post-1980s highlight different ecological or geopolitical influences affecting phosphate nutrient levels in these countries, showcasing distinct responses to agronomic and environmental factors over time.
