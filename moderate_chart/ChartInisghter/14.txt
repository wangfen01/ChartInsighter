The chart presents a line graph illustrating international tourist departures per 1,000 people from 1995 to 2022, comparing trends across Canada and Norway. This data visualization examines how tourism departure rates have evolved over time within these two countries.In Canada, the period from 1995 to 2014 marks a general increase in international tourist departures, achieving a peak of 940.836 departures per 1,000 people in 2014. Following this peak, the trend was characterized by increased volatility and a downturn, reaching its lowest point of 128.82906 in 2021. However, there was a resurgence in international tourism from 2021 to 2022, bringing the figure up to 551.2443.Norway experienced a different pattern over the same period. From 1995, the number of international tourist departures per 1,000 people rose steadily, peaking at 1843.1964 in 2012. Although there was a dip observed in 2020, Norway's trend showed a recovery from 2020 to 2022, rising from 314.1688 to 1290.1346.When comparing the trends across these two dimensions, both Canada and Norway exhibited an overarching growth in tourism departures from the mid-1990s until the early 2010s. Nevertheless, starting from 2014, a divergence became apparent; Canada faced a volatile decline, whereas Norway successfully continued its upward trajectory until the early 2020s. From 2020 onwards, a shared theme of recovery emerged across both countries, although the rate of increase in departures was significantly more pronounced in Norway than in Canada. This distinction highlights variations in the pace and magnitude of tourism recovery in these two nations during the post-2020 period.
