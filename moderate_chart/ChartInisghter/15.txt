The chart presents a line graph illustrating the trends of international tourist departures per 1,000 people from 1995 to 2022 for two countries: Armenia and Zimbabwe. This analysis spans several decades, providing insights into how outbound tourism has evolved in these nations over time.For Armenia, the data reveals a robust upward trend in international tourist departures per 1,000 people starting from 2003 through 2019. During this period, the figures rose significantly, commencing at 55.61 in 2003 and peaking at a remarkable 643.26 in 2019. However, the trend experienced a sharp reversal between 2019 and 2020, likely due to global disruptions, as the figure plummeted to 119.69. Subsequent years up to 2022 showed a moderate recovery trajectory with values climbing back to 395.36, indicating resilience and a return towards pre-2020 levels.In the case of Zimbabwe, the trend from 2003 to 2015 was characterized by high volatility yet an overall increase, culminating in a peak of 235.64 in 2015. Post-2015, the trend shifted direction; the country endured a gradual decline in tourist departures with reduced fluctuations, hitting a low of 37.79 in 2021 and maintaining this downward trend into 2022, despite global conditions.When contrasting these trends, the countries exhibit divergent trajectories, particularly evident from 2020 onwards. While Armenia began recovering from its dip following the global downturn in 2020, Zimbabwe continued its decline, which started in 2015, unaffected by the trend reversal in Armenia. This divergence may highlight differing regional dynamics or responses to external factors, with Armenia showing signs of rebound that Zimbabwe's data does not reflect. These contrasts draw attention to the varied nature of international tourism recovery and persistence trends across different countries over this time frame.
