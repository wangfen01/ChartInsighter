The chart provides a detailed visualization of the number of terrorist attacks in Lebanon over a substantial time range, from 1970 to 2021. The data is presented as a line graph, capturing the temporal evolution of attack frequencies within this timeframe.Throughout this period, the trends in terrorist attacks in Lebanon reveal distinctive phases marked by varying levels of volatility and changes in frequency. Initially, from 1970 to 1971, there was a period characterized by low volatility and a minor decrease in attacks, maintaining a single recorded attack in 1970, pointing to a relatively stable start. This stability sharply contrasts with the subsequent period from 1971 to 1983, which experienced high volatility, culminating in a dramatic peak in 1983 with 234 terrorist incidents. This surge marks the most significant increase within the dataset.Post-1983, the chart shows a prolonged period from 1983 to 2014, where the number of attacks generally decreased with low volatility, hitting a notable low point of 1 attack in 2004. This suggests a phase of stabilization and reduction in the frequency of terrorist activities over several decades. However, from 2014 onward, the data illustrates a renewed phase of high volatility. Despite considerable fluctuations, the general trend from 2014 to 2021 is downward, reaching a minimal attack count of 1 by 2021, after another peak in 2014 with 205 attacks.The relationship between these trends underscores an initial period of calm, followed by sporadic and intense activity leading up to 1983, then a prolonged downturn in attacks, and finally a period marked by fluctuations post-2014. These temporal shifts highlight significant historical changes in the security landscape of Lebanon, reflecting periods of both relative peace and turbulence.
