The chart presents a line graph detailing the sex ratio of five-year-olds from 1950 to a recent year across Angola, Belize, and South Korea.  This data tracks the number of boys per 100 girls at age five, offering a comparative view of demographic trends in these countries over the decades.

In Angola, the sex ratio began with noticeable growth from 1950, reaching 105.47 by 1955.  However, from 1969 to 1975, there was a significant decline, with the ratio dropping to 98.97.  Post-1975, Angola experienced a gradual upward trend, culminating at a ratio of 101.17 in 2023.  This reflects periods of both growth and contraction within their demographic developments.

Belize showed a consistent increase in the sex ratio between 1950 and 1985, starting at 96.49 and reaching 104.47.  The subsequent short period until 1988 witnessed a slight decline to 101.30, but this was followed by another rising phase, peaking at 104.86 by 2023.  This indicates an overall upward trajectory, with only minor interruptions in growth.

South Korea's sex ratio trend initially rose between 1950 and 1952 to 117.51, followed by a decline to 103.52 by 1956.  A long phase of low volatility ensued, with an increasing trend from 1956 to 1999, reaching 117.44.  After 1999, the trend reversed, declining until 2019, where it stabilized at 104.95.  This pattern highlights significant initial shifts, followed by a prolonged stable rise and recent decline.

Comparing these trends, all three countries demonstrate an initial post-1950 increase in their sex ratios.  Angola and Belize continued their growth trends, yet Angola uniquely showed a marked downturn from 1969 to 1975, contrasting with the more consistent trends in Belize.  South Korea, while starting similarly, diverged with a distinct period of low volatility and then decline, markedly differing from the stable increases seen in Belize and the more variable trends in Angola.  The main parallels lie in the early rises, whereas significant differences are illustrated in Angola's mid-century decline and South Korea's volatility and later decrease.
