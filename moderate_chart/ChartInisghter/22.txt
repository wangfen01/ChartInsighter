The chart presents a line graph illustrating the historical trends of birth rates in New Zealand and Taiwan over an extensive time frame from 1855 to 2010.   This data facilitates a comparative perspective on how the birth rates per 1,000 people evolved in these two countries.

In New Zealand, the birth rate initially shows a decreasing trajectory from 1855, dropping to a level of 35.3 births per 1,000 people by 1863.   Soon after, a marked rise is recorded between 1863 and 1866, peaking at 42.9.   However, this upward spike is followed by a substantial decline leading to the end of the 19th century, with the rate plummeting to 25.1 by 1899.   The early 20th century witnessed a moderate recovery from 1899 to 1908, with the rate nudging up to 27.5.   This was succeeded by a long-term downtrend lasting until 1935, reaching a low of 17.4.   A recovery ensued from 1935, peaking at 27.7 in 1947, before embarking on a consistent downward path from 1961 onwards, recording 15.7 in 1982 and further declining to 13.7 by 2009.

Taiwan's birth rate trend showcases a different dynamic.   From 1906 till 1947, there was a steady increase, culminating during 1931 at 45.8.   The rise continued post-World War II, achieving 50 births per 1,000 people by 1951.   This marked the highest point, after which the birth rates entered a long-term decline, characterized by an uneven pattern initially, but eventually smoothening into a significant drop, landing at 7.2 births per 1,000 by 2010.

Comparing the trends of New Zealand and Taiwan reveals both shared and distinct features.   In the early 20th century, both nations experienced increasing birth rates, with significant peaks noted particularly in the 1930s and 1940s.   However, divergence is apparent in the latter half of the century.   Taiwan's rates declined sharply beginning in the 1950s, whereas, New Zealand's decline was paced differently, noted at various intervals, both prior to and after mid-century.   This comparative analysis underscores shared peak periods in mid-century followed by substantial declines for both countries, but with divergent temporal patterns.
