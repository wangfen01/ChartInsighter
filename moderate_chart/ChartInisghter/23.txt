The chart presents a detailed analysis of refugee populations in Lebanon and the United Kingdom from the mid-20th century to recent years.   By examining the trends over time, the graph provides insights into the shifts in refugee numbers in these two distinct regions, highlighting both synchronous and divergent patterns.

In Lebanon, the period from 1964 to 1976 marked a significant surge, peaking at 700,000 refugees in 1976.   This peak was sustained through 1977, followed by a gradual decrease until the early 1990s, with the refugee count plummeting to as low as 2,550 in 1990.   A sustained decline continued until 2005, where the numbers were recorded at 1,078.   However, between 2005 and 2014, a substantial upward swing occurred, reaching 1,154,029.   After 2014, the number again trended downward, closing at 788,472 by 2023.

Conversely, the United Kingdom's refugee data begins in 1951 with a high of 208,000.   The trend was consistently downwards until 1988, when figures hit 39,755.   This was followed by a reversal, characterized by a volatile increase until 2005, where numbers peaked at 303,163.   A more stable decline ensued from 2005 to 2014, reducing the refugee population to 117,226.   Post-2014, the trend shifted to another upward move marked by high volatility, reaching 448,620 by 2023.

The relationship between these two datasets reveals shared upward trends during the mid-2000s to 2014, indicating a broader global influence causing an increase in refugee movements to both regions.   However, after 2014, their trends diverge, with Lebanon experiencing a decline while the United Kingdom saw an increase with considerable volatility.   This divergence underscores the varied regional influences impacting refugee movements, illustrating the complex dynamics at play in global refugee trends.
