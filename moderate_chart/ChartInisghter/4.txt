The chart captures the time-series trends of fish landings by British vessels over a period extending from 1889 to 2007, specifically focusing on the regions of England and Wales, as well as the broader United Kingdom. This visualization presents a comparative analysis of fish landings across these areas, providing a historical perspective on the fluctuations and patterns in this sector.In examining the trends for England and Wales, fish landings experienced substantial growth from 1889, reaching a peak of 457,105 metric tons in 1907. However, this upward trajectory was disrupted between 1907 and 1917, where landings dwindled significantly to 140,084 metric tons. A notable recovery ensued from 1917 to 1920, peaking again at 482,935 metric tons, and continued to climb until 1937, where it reached 677,365 metric tons. The following years until 1941 saw another significant decrease to 115,060 metric tons. Post-1941, a recovery unfolded, leading to a second peak at 638,641 metric tons by 1949. Yet, from this point onwards to 1969, a gradual decline set in, culminating in 469,559 metric tons. From 1969 to 1990, a marked long-term decrease was evident, with landings recording a low of 83,800 metric tons.Similarly, fish landings by British vessels throughout the entire United Kingdom demonstrated an initial upward trend starting in 1889, achieving 614,099 metric tons by 1911. After this, a decline occurred, bottoming out at 194,438 metric tons in 1917. The next few years post-1917 marked a volatile yet significant recovery, peaking at 642,343 metric tons in 1920. From 1920 to 1937, there was a steady incline, reaching 804,633 metric tons. However, this upward trend was interrupted from 1937 to 1941, with landings dropping sharply to 187,598 metric tons. A rebound occurred from 1941 onwards, peaking at 803,492 metric tons by 1949 before entering a prolonged period of decline, hitting 148,000 metric tons by 2007.When evaluating the relationship between the time-series across these dimensions, a recurring pattern emerges whereby both England and Wales, and the UK as a whole, exhibit similar trends. Both start with significant growth in the late 1800s to early 1900s, face a series of declines post-1900, and recover significantly post-World War I. Their trajectories align as they both continue growing into the 1930s before experiencing concurrent downturns as World War II approaches. Both regions witness strong post-war recoveries but subsequently enter a shared prolonged decline from 1949 onwards. This parallel behavior underscores common economic and environmental challenges impacting fish landings across both divisions throughout the specified timeframe.
