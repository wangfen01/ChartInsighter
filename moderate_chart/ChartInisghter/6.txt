The chart presents a time-series analysis of the sex ratio trends in Algeria and China, spanning from 1950 to 2023. This visual representation compares the two countries, capturing changes and patterns in their respective sex ratios over the decades.In Algeria, the sex ratio witnessed a decline from 105.03 in 1950 to 103.28 in 1951. This was followed by an upward trend, reaching 108.85 by 1965. From then on, a downward trajectory was evident, continuing until 1980 when the ratio settled at 103.49, a level it maintained until 1991. A noticeable increase between 1991 and 1997 saw the sex ratio rise to 108.34, after which it declined to 103.85 by 1999. Although there was a slight rise to 104.81 in 2006, the general trend post-1999 has been a sustained decline, continuing through to 2023.China's sex ratio initially decreased slightly from 105.85947 in 1950 to 104.85175 in 1951. A period of high volatility characterized the subsequent years, with the sex ratio generally increasing and reaching a peak of 117.48244 in 2006. After the peak, the ratio decreased steadily to 110.41473 by 2022, with low volatility marking this phase.A comparative analysis of the sex ratio trends in Algeria and China underlines both commonalities and differences. Both countries showed a decline in the early 1950s and experienced substantial peaks around 2006, followed by declines. However, the magnitude and volatility of these changes varied significantly. Notably, Algeria's sex ratio increased steadily until the mid-1960s and then entered a predominantly declining phase interrupted by a brief rise in the early 1990s, contrasting with China's prolonged increase until its 2006 peak. China's trend, marked by higher volatility over the years, and a notable post-peak decrease, distinguishes its pattern from Algeria's more understated fluctuations and largely stable post-peak evolution.
