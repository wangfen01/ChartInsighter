The chart displays a line graph that captures the trends in the average effective age of retirement in Italy and Mexico from 1994 through 2018. Within this span, the data is divided by country, allowing for a comparison of retirement age dynamics in both Italy and Mexico.Analyzing the Italian trend, from 1994 to 1996, there was a slight increase in the retirement age, culminating at 60.0 years in 1996. This upward movement was followed by a decline until 1999, reaching a local minimum of 58.1 years. Between 1999 and 2009, the retirement age in Italy showed a downward trend, with low volatility, fluctuating occasionally but maintaining the minimum value of 58.1 years and reaching a brief peak at 60.0 years by 2002. From 2009 onwards, a noticeable increase was observed, with the retirement age climbing to 61.5 years by 2018.In Mexico, the average effective age of retirement initially decreased from 1994 and hit its lowest point at 68.0 years in 2002. This was then followed by an upward trend with significant volatility from 2002 to 2007, resulting in a high of 74.7 years. However, from 2007 to 2017, the trend reversed with the retirement age decreasing to reach 66.2 years in 2017.Comparing these trends reveals a pattern of contrasts and occasional similarities between the two countries. While Italy experienced a slight increase followed by a steady decrease between 1994 and 1999, Mexico's trend was solely declining during this period. Both countries experienced a general decline in the late 1990s, although Italy had lower volatility compared to Mexico's steadier decrease until 2002. From 2002 to 2007, as Italy's retirement age was relatively stable, Mexico saw significant volatility with an upward trend. Interestingly, from 2007 onward, the trends diverge more markedly: Italy's retirement age began to increase, while Mexico's decreased. This period highlights the most pronounced divergence between the two, underscoring different policy impacts or socio-economic factors influencing retirement age in each country.
