The chart presents a comparative analysis of patent applications per million people between India and Cuba over a period from 1980 to 2021. This line graph captures the distinct trajectories these two countries took in their patent activity across the decades.In India, the trend begins with a decline in patent applications, starting from 1.732 applications per million people in 1980 and diminishing to 1.211 by 1987. This initial period of decline gives way to a prolonged phase of volatility and growth from 1987 onwards, with patent applications per million people consistently increasing, eventually reaching 18.661 by 2021. This period marks a significant positive shift, indicating a robust upward trend.Conversely, Cuba experienced a different pattern. Initially, there was a slight increase in patent applications, peaking in 1984 with 21.261 applications. However, this peak was followed by a dramatic decline that continued until 1993, when the applications dropped to a mere 0.092 per million people. Though there was a brief uptick in 1994 to 11.114, the general trend after this period was a continued decline with minor fluctuations, persisting through to 2021.Comparatively, the early years of the 1980s show a decline for both nations, albeit for different reasons. India's decline was gradual, ending in 1987, while Cuba's descent was preceded by a high peak in 1984. Post-1987, the trajectories of the two countries diverge sharply. India's recovery and subsequent growth contrast with Cuba's stabilization at much lower levels and a continued downward trend. This divergence post-1993 highlights the contrasting paths in patent activity, with India's dynamic increase set against Cuba's relatively stable yet declining numbers.
