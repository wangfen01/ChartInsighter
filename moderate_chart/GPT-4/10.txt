The line chart details the historical trends of rental vacancy rates in the United States, spanning from 1965 through the present. The data reveal a dynamic fluctuation in vacancy rates, initially recorded at 8.5% in 1965 and demonstrating variable shifts over the decades. A gradual decrease was noted until the late 1980s, where a low of 5.1% was observed in 1987. Subsequently, vacancy rates increased, peaking at around 11.1% in 2009 amid the housing crisis. The trend since then has shown a general decline, stabilizing to around 6.6% in recent years. This suggests a recovery and stabilization in the rental market post-crisis. The overall trajectory of vacancy rates illustrates the responsiveness of the rental market to economic conditions, reflecting higher vacancies during downturns and lower rates during economic stability.
