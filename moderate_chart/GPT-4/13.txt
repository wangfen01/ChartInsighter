The nutrient phosphate levels in Myanmar remained relatively low and stable from 1961 to the early 1970s, hovering around 0.1 to 1.48, before experiencing sporadic increases and decreases. Significant spikes occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with values reaching over 4.73 in 1985. There was a sharp decline in the late 1980s and 1990s, but from the early 2000s, Myanmar saw more volatility, with nutrient phosphate levels peaking at 14.48 in 2019. On the other hand, Iceland's nutrient phosphate levels started at 26.88 in 1961, steadily rising through the 1960s and 1970s, peaking at 73.32 in 2014. However, from 2015 onwards, Icelandâ€™s values dropped drastically, with the lowest point in 2017 at 16.91. Despite this decline, Iceland's levels remained considerably higher than those of Myanmar throughout the observed period. The two countries exhibit contrasting trends, with Iceland maintaining consistently higher values and Myanmar showing more erratic fluctuations.
