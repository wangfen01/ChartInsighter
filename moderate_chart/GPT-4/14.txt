Afterward, it fluctuated slightly before a sharp drop in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, falling to 235 and 128, respectively, with a partial recovery to 551 in 2022. Norway, in contrast, started much lower at 135 in 1995 but saw a sharp rise, especially from 2009 onwards, peaking at 1,843 in 2012. However, like Canada, it experienced a significant drop in 2020 and 2021 before recovering to 1,290 in 2022.
