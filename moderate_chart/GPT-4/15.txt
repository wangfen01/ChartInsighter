Between 2003 and 2022, international tourist departures per 1,000 people show a stark contrast between Armenia and Zimbabwe. Armenia exhibits a steady increase, starting from 55.6 departures per 1,000 people in 2003 and peaking at 643.3 in 2019. However, there is a sharp decline in 2020, likely due to global travel restrictions, falling to 119.7, and only partially recovering to 395.4 by 2022. Zimbabwe's trend, while more volatile, shows a gradual rise from 31.6 in 2003, peaking sharply at 235.6 in 2015 before experiencing a significant decline to 63.9 in 2020. By 2022, Zimbabwe's rate rose slightly to 100.2, showing a slower recovery compared to Armenia. Overall, Armenia's tourism departures grew more robustly than Zimbabwe's, with both countries significantly impacted by the global travel disruptions in 2020.
