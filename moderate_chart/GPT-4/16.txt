The line chart illustrates the fluctuation in the number of terrorist attacks in Lebanon over a span from 1970 to 2021. Initially, the attacks are sparse and relatively low in frequency, with the numbers ranging from 1 to 15 attacks per year during the early 1970s to mid-1970s. However, a significant escalation is observed starting in the late 1970s, peaking dramatically in 1983 with 234 attacks. This peak is followed by a generally high but fluctuating number of incidents through the 1980s and early 1990s, reflecting periods of intense conflict.

Post-1994, there is a notable decrease in the frequency of attacks, with numbers predominantly falling below 50 annually. The data shows a brief resurgence in the mid-2000s, peaking again in 2013 and 2014 with over 100 attacks each year, before tapering off to minimal levels by 2021. This trend suggests periods of relative stability interspersed with years of significant turmoil, possibly reflecting varying political and military dynamics within the region over the decades. The visualized data underscores a complex relationship between temporal factors and the intensity of terrorist activities in Lebanon, marking years of intense conflict followed by relative calm.
