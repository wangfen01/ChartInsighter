The line chart depicting patent applications per million people in Cuba from 1980 to 2021 illustrates a marked fluctuation and overall decline in patent activity over four decades. Initially, patent applications showed variability with peaks reaching as high as 21.26 in 1984, followed by a drastic drop to nearly zero by 1992 and 1993, possibly reflecting significant economic or policy changes during that period. After this sharp decline, there was a partial recovery in the mid-1990s, with values hovering around 10 patent applications per million, stabilizing somewhat until the early 2000s.

Post-2005, a consistent downward trend is observed, with patent applications steadily decreasing from approximately 9.3 to just under 2 by 2021. This trend could be indicative of ongoing economic challenges, changes in intellectual property law or enforcement, or shifts in innovation focus within the country. The chart captures these shifts succinctly, providing a clear view of the long-term changes in the rate at which Cubans have been applying for patents.
