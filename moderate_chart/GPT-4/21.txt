The chart presents a detailed time series analysis of the sex ratio of five-year-old children in Angola, Belize, and South Korea, tracking changes from 1950 to the most recent year. It visualizes the number of boys per 100 girls at age five and demonstrates distinct trends and variations across the decades and among these countries.
In Angola, the sex ratio initially shows an ascending trend, starting at 99.78487 in 1950 and peaking at 105.63909 in 1969, indicating a gradual increase in the male proportion. This peak is followed by a slow decline, stabilizing around 100 from the late 1990s onward, reflecting a closer balance between male and female births.
Belize's pattern exhibits a more volatile journey, with the sex ratio initially below 100, suggesting fewer boys per 100 girls. However, the ratio increases over the years, surpassing the 100 mark consistently from the mid-1950s. The peak occurs in the mid-1990s at 104.67445, after which it slightly tapers off, yet remains above 100, indicating a sustained higher proportion of boys.
South Korea presents a unique case where the sex ratio was markedly higher from the outset, starting at 103.74509 in 1950 and dramatically spiking to 117.50976 in 1952. It then normalizes somewhat but still remains high, generally above 107, peaking again in 1999 at 117.44239. This exceptionally high ratio suggests a significant demographic imbalance favoring boys, which has only recently begun to approach a more balanced state.
The interactions between these trends reveal not just differences in the absolute numbers but also in the demographic strategies or natural occurrences affecting these populations. The consistent elevation of South Koreaâ€™s sex ratio throughout the period underlines a stark contrast to the other two countries, reflecting deeper societal preferences or policies favoring male children. Meanwhile, the converging trends of Angola and Belize towards the more balanced ratio point towards a demographic normalization over the decades.
