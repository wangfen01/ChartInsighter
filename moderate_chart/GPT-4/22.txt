The chart shows a line graph of the birth rate in New Zealand and Taiwan from the mid-19th century to 2010. The birth rate in New Zealand was initially high, peaking at 42.9 births per 1,000 people in 1866, and then gradually decreased over the years. By 1900, the rate had dropped to 25.6 births per 1,000, and continued to decline throughout the 20th century. In 1950, it stood at 25.9, and by the year 2000, it had further decreased to 14.7, with a slight uptick to 15.1 in 1998, before reaching 14.4 in 2001. The rate remained relatively stable in the early 21st century, ending at 14.0 in 2009.
In contrast, Taiwan's birth rate showed a much higher level for a significant portion of the time period. It peaked at 50 births per 1,000 people in 1951 and remained high through the 1950s, before gradually decreasing from the 1960s onward. In 1960, the rate was 39.5, and it continued to fall, reaching 11.7 in 2001 and further dropping to 7.2 by 2010.
While both countries saw a decline in birth rates, Taiwan’s decrease was more dramatic, especially in the latter half of the 20th century. In the early 20th century, Taiwan's birth rates were consistently higher than New Zealand's, with Taiwan's rates generally remaining above 40 births per 1,000 until the 1950s. From the 1960s onward, however, both countries exhibited similar trends of steady decline, but Taiwan's birth rate dropped much more quickly. By 2000, New Zealand's birth rate was still higher than Taiwan's, but by 2010, Taiwan's rate had fallen below New Zealand’s.
In summary, the chart illustrates the stark contrast in the birth rate trends of the two countries. New Zealand’s rate was consistently higher in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but Taiwan's rate surged dramatically in the mid-20th century before experiencing a more rapid decline in recent decades. Both countries are currently facing low birth rates, with Taiwan's rate being lower than New Zealand's in the last decade.
