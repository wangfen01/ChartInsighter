The chart shows a line graph of per capita CO₂ emissions from coal in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States over time. The data reveals a steady increase in CO₂ emissions from coal in all three countries, though the patterns of growth differ significantly.
In India, the emissions began at a very low level in the mid-19th century, starting at just 0.0016 tonnes per person in 1858. The trend remained flat for many years, with a gradual rise seen after 1878, when emissions reached 0.0069 tonnes per person. The increase became more pronounced in the mid-20th century, with a sharp rise from 0.2016 tonnes per person in 1960 to 0.5415 tonnes in 2000. After the year 2000, emissions continued to rise, reaching 1.413 tonnes per person in 2023, showing an ongoing trend of rapid growth in recent years.
In contrast, the United Kingdom saw much higher emissions earlier in its timeline, starting at 1.0019 tonnes per person in 1750. Emissions grew steadily through the Industrial Revolution, peaking in the mid-20th century at over 10 tonnes per person, particularly around the years 1910–1930, when they reached 10.61 tonnes per person in 1911. Following a gradual decline post-World War II, emissions fell dramatically from the 1970s onward, dropping to 0.2556 tonnes per person in 2023, reflecting the UK’s shift away from coal.
The United States, starting at 0.042 tonnes per person in 1800, showed similar growth patterns to the UK during its early industrial period. Emissions grew rapidly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, peaking at 6.55 tonnes per person in 1930. Afterward, emissions continued to rise but at a slower rate, reaching 5.99 tonnes per person by 1990. In the 21st century, emissions saw a notable decrease, with a sharp drop from 5.79 tonnes per person in 2007 to 1.39 tonnes per person in 2023, paralleling the UK’s trend of reducing coal dependence.
Overall, while the UK and the US both show a significant decline in emissions in recent decades, driven by a reduction in coal usage, India’s emissions continue to rise sharply, reflecting its growing reliance on coal for energy and industrial development. The trends for India and the other two countries illustrate a contrast between historical industrialization and modern shifts toward cleaner energy in the UK and the US. India’s emissions, though initially much lower, are now approaching the levels seen in these historically high-emission countries, indicating a major shift in global CO₂ emission patterns.
