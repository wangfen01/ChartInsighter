Analyzing the historical trends in terrorist attacks in Lebanon and El Salvador from 1970 through 2021 reveals stark differences in their patterns. In Lebanon, the number of attacks initially is low, registering single-digit figures annually until a significant escalation begins around 1973, peaking dramatically in 1983 with 234 attacks. This peak is followed by fluctuating yet high levels of activity through the late 1980s and 1990s. After a temporary drop in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there's a resurgence in 2013 with 121 attacks, peaking again in 2014 at 205 attacks. Post-2014, the figures show a marked decrease, with numbers tapering off to single digits by 2021.

El Salvador, on the other hand, experiences virtually no terrorist activities until 1978, after which there is a sharp increase, reaching a peak in 1980 with 710 attacks. This period likely corresponds with the height of the Salvadoran Civil War. Post-war, the number of incidents declines rapidly after 1992, falling to zero annually by the late 1990s, and maintaining this level with the exception of a single incident in 2021.

This comparative analysis suggests that while both countries have experienced periods of intense conflict leading to high numbers of terrorist attacks, Lebanon has seen several resurgences over the decades unlike El Salvador, where post-conflict stabilization seems to have maintained a long-term decrease in such violent incidents. These patterns underscore the varying impacts of political and historical contexts on domestic security issues in the two countries.
