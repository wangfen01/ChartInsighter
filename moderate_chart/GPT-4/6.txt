The line chart, comparing the sex ratio across years between Algeria and China, reveals several notable trends and relationships in the data. From 1950 to 2023, Algeria's sex ratio shows fluctuations but maintains a relatively stable range, peaking in the mid-1960s and experiencing another rise in the mid-1970s, before settling back into a stable pattern from the late 1970s onward, with minor upticks around 1992 and the mid-2010s. In contrast, China's sex ratio has been on a consistent upward trajectory since 1950, intensifying particularly after the 1980s, reaching its highest levels in the early 2000s before beginning a slight decline in the 2010s.

This contrast highlights a divergent demographic trend: while Algeria shows stability with mild fluctuations, China's policy impacts and demographic shifts are evident in its steadily increasing, then slightly decreasing sex ratio. This suggests deeper societal changes influencing these trends in each country. The visualization provides a clear depiction of how policies and societal structures over decades influence demographic metrics like the sex ratio, reflected differently in each nation's data across the observed years.
