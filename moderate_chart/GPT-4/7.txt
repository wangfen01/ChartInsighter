The line chart provides a comparative analysis of the average effective age of retirement between Italy and Mexico from 1994 to 2018. In Italy, the retirement age shows minor fluctuations, starting at around 59.7 years in 1994, decreasing slightly to the late 58s in the mid-2000s, and then rising gradually to reach 61.5 years by 2018. This trend suggests a gradual increase in the retirement age over the years, possibly reflecting changes in national policy or economic conditions favoring later retirement. Conversely, Mexico presents a more erratic trend, starting at a considerably higher retirement age of 73.3 years in 1994, experiencing significant dips and recoveries, and finally decreasing to 66.5 years by 2018. The pronounced variability in Mexico could be indicative of broader economic fluctuations or shifts in social policy impacting when individuals retire. Overall, the data reveal significant differences in retirement age dynamics between the two countries, with Italy showing a steady increase and Mexico displaying more volatility.
