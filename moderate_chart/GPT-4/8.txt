The line chart compares patent applications per million people between India and Cuba from 1980 to 2021. India's data shows a steady and significant increase over time, with patent applications per million people rising from around 1.73 in 1980 to over 18.66 by 2021. The growth is particularly noticeable from 2005 onwards, where India’s figures show consistent annual increases, indicating a rapid expansion in patent activity. In contrast, Cuba's data exhibits more fluctuations, with high levels of patent applications in the early 1980s, peaking at over 21.26 in 1984, followed by a sharp decline in the 1990s. After 1994, Cuba’s numbers remain much lower, with a gradual decrease to around 1.86 in 2021. The contrasting trends highlight India’s significant upward momentum in innovation, while Cuba’s patent activity appears to have diminished over the years.
