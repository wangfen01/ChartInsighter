The visualization is a line chart that represents the levels of nutrient phosphate in Myanmar and Iceland from 1961 to 2021. The chart plots 'Year' on the x-axis as a temporal field and 'Nutrient phosphate' on the y-axis as a quantitative field. Each country, represented by the 'Entity' field, is encoded with a different color to distinguish between the two lines on the chart. Interactivity is provided through tooltips that display the country name, year, and nutrient phosphate level when hovering over points on the lines. The visualization likely depicts a comparison of nutrient phosphate levels between Myanmar and Iceland from 1961 to 2021, showing Myanmar's levels ranging from a low of 14.48 to an average of 2.6025, with a slight increase over time, while Iceland's levels are much higher on average at 44.9316, despite a notable decrease of 11.99 during the same period.
