This visual line graph represents the number of terrorist attacks in Lebanon between 1970 and 1983. The x-axis of the chart is the “year” and the y-axis is the “number of terrorist attacks”. Each point on the line segment corresponds to the number of terrorist attacks in a given year, and viewers can hover over the points to interact with the chart and view tooltips containing specific data for each year. The visualization might depict a fluctuating line graph showing the number of terrorist attacks in Lebanon from 1970 to 1983, with the peak in 1983 representing the highest number of attacks, and the notable peak from 1982 to 1983 representing the largest increase of 114 attacks. The starting year, 1970, is the lowest point on the graph and the year with the lowest number of attacks during that period.
