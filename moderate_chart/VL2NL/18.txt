This visualization is a line chart that displays the trend of patent applications per million people in Cuba from 1980 to 2021. The horizontal axis represents the years in an ordinal manner, while the vertical axis quantifies the number of patent applications per million people. The chart is designed to show changes over time, with a tooltip feature that provides additional information about the year and the corresponding number of patent applications per million people when a user hovers over the chart. No composite views or data transformations are indicated, and the chart follows the default styling conventions of Vega-Lite. The visualization would likely show a bar graph with a notable peak in 1984, indicating the highest number of patent applications per million people in Cuba during the observed period. It would also highlight 1981 as the year with the lowest number of patent applications per million, with the average number of applications from 1980 to 2021 being approximately 7.192, which could be represented by a horizontal line across the graph to denote the average.
