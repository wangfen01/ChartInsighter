This visualization is a line chart titled "Per Capita CO₂Emissions from Coal in India, 1858 to Recent Years". It plots the annual CO2 emissions from coal on a per capita basis over time, with the x-axis representing the year (temporal) and the y-axis representing the tonnes of CO2 per person (quantitative). The data is differentiated by country, indicated by the color encoding for the 'Entity' field, which includes India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The chart provides interactive tooltips that display the year and the corresponding annual CO2 emissions from coal per capita when a user hovers over the line.The visualization would likely depict a time series showing the fluctuation of India's per capita CO₂emissions from coal, highlighting the peak in 2023 at approximately 1.413 tonnes per person and the historic low in 1858 at 0.00163 tonnes per person. It would also show an average emission value of around 0.2711 tonnes per person over the observed period, with a clear upward trend leading to the 2023 peak, contrasting with the much lower historical emissions.
