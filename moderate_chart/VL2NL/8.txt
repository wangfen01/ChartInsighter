This is a line chart that visualizes the patent applications per million people in India and Cuba over time. The chart plots data from a CSV file, with the horizontal axis representing the year (ordinal) and the vertical axis showing the number of patent applications per million people (quantitative). Each country is represented by a line with a distinct color: blue for India and orange for Cuba. The chart is designed with a width of 800 pixels and a height of 400 pixels. Interactive tooltips provide additional information about the country, year, and patent applications per million when a user hovers over the chart. The visualization likely depicts a comparison of patent applications per million people between India and Cuba from 1980 to 2021, highlighting Cuba's significantly higher average in this metric over the period, with its peak in 1984, while India's peak occurred in 2021. The graph would show a specific point where the difference between the two countries in 2021 is approximately 16.8 patent applications per million people, with India trailing behind Cuba.
