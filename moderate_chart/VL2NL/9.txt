This visualization is a line chart that displays the trends of values over time for different symbols. The chart plots data from a CSV file, with the x-axis representing the observation date in a 'YYYY-MM-DD' format and the y-axis representing the quantitative values. Two distinct symbols, 'APU1' and 'APU2', are differentiated by color, with 'APU1' shown in blue and 'APU2' in orange. The chart is designed with a width of 800 pixels and a height of 400 pixels, and it includes an interactive tooltip feature that provides additional information about the symbol, observation date, and value when a user hovers over the lines. The visualization likely depicts a comparison between two financial instruments, APU1 and APU2, showing that APU1 consistently maintains higher values throughout the observation period with its maximum, minimum, and average values all exceeding those of APU2. The data suggests a possible positive correlation within each symbol's value over time, but a divergence between the two symbols, as APU1's average value is notably higher than APU2's.
