This chart displays the line graphs of AAABAA and DGS over time.    Initially, AAABAA exhibited a downward trend, but it gradually shifted to an upward trend after 2005.    It began a sustained increase at the start of 2008, peaking at 3.38 in December 2008, then sharply declined to 1.18 by September 2009, and subsequently stabilized, fluctuating between 0.66 and 1.5.    Similarly, DGS initially showed a downward trend, then began to rise in 2005, reaching a peak of 2.416 in December 2008.    During this period, it also experienced a sharp increase similar to that of AAABAA, but then quickly fell, reaching its lowest point in 2010, and then rose and remained relatively stable, fluctuating around 0.5.    The behaviors of these two indices were very synchronized and possibly interconnected.    After the peak, both indices declined, but subsequent recovery showed different dynamics.    AAABAA recovered more quickly, while DGS recovered more smoothly and slowly.
