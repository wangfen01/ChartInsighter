The graph shows the trend of sex ratio at birth from 1950 to 2023 in Armenia and China, which show significantly different development tracks.
In 1950, China's sex ratio was 105.86, though 1951 witnessed a slight dip, China's sex ratio kept climbing to a peak of 117.48 in 2006.    It then began a slow decline, falling to 110.63 in 2023.
Armenia's sex ratio slowly rose from 104.41 in 1950 to a high of 105.16 in 1975, followed by a decline, reaching a low of 102.47 in 1977, after which it recovered however experienced another dip in 1985.    It fluctuated between 1986 and 1992.    But then a big rise occurred since then to 2002 at 116.9.    At last, it fluctuated downwards to 108.47 in 2023.
It is worth noting that both countries experienced significant increases in sex ratios in the early 2000s, but the timing and duration of the peaks were different.    The sex ratio in China remained high at 116-117 during 2000-2010, while Armenia reached a peak of more than 115 during 2002-2007.    Since around 2010, the sex ratio in both countries has shown a downward trend.    The downward trend may reflect that measures taken in both countries to correct the gender imbalance are starting to take effect, but China's sex ratio remains significantly higher than normal.
