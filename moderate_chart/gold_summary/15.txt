This chart shows the trend of international tourist departures (per 1000 people) from 2003 to 2022 in Armenia and Zimbabwe.

Armenia has shown a significant upward trend throughout the period, with a sharp increase from 55.6 in 2003 to 643.3 in 2019.    Armenia's numbers have plummeted to 119.7 in 2020, a drop of 81.4%.    Armenia recovered slightly to 395.4 in 2022.

Zimbabwe's growth has been slower and less volatile.    It was quite stable from 23.3 in 1995 to 52.1 in 2012.    The year 2013 was a key turning point for Zimbabwe, with a sudden jump to 210.2, an increase of more than 300%, and then it reached a plateau between 2013 and 2019.    Zimbabwe dropped from 214.5 in 2019 to 37.8 in 2021 followed by a rebound.

It should be noted that Armenia maintained a greater growth trend throughout the observation period.    Both countries experienced a sharp fall in 2019, and by 2022, there had been a rebound in both countries.
