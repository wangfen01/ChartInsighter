The chart illustrates the trends in the sex ratio from 1950 to 2023 for Angola, Belize, and South Korea. 
Angola stayed stable in the sex ratio from 99.78 in 1950 to approximately 105.64 in 1969. Then, there was a rapid decline reaching around 98.97 by 1975. From the mid-1970s onwards, the sex ratio stabilized near 100 and exhibited a slight upward trend, reaching 101.17 by 2023. Belize started with a sex ratio of 96.49 in 1950, saw a steady increase throughout the 1950s, stayed stable in the mid-1960s, and continued to rise to 104.11 by 1975.  The sex ratio remained relatively stable around 104 from the late 1970s to the early 2000s. In recent decades, Belize maintained a consistent sex ratio with minor fluctuations, slightly declining to 102.2 in 2009, and ending at 104.86 in 2023. South Korea began with a sex ratio of 103.75 in 1950 and experienced a rapid increase during the early 1950s and 1990s, peaking at approximately 117.44 in 1999. After that, the sex ratio in South Korea slightly declined over the subsequent years, dropping to around 105. In comparison, while Angola and South Korea both saw significant increases in their sex ratios during the mid-20th century, Angola's ratio stabilized and slightly increased in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Conversely, South Korea's sex ratio peaked around the turn of the century before experiencing a gradual decline. Belize maintained a more stable sex ratio after the 1970s, with only minor variations over the decades.
