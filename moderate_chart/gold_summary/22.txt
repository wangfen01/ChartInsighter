The line graph depicts the changes in the birth rates (births per thousand people) in New Zealand from 1855 to 2009 and in Taiwan from 1906 to 2010. In New Zealand, the birth rate remained between 35‰ and 43‰ from 1855 to 1880, followed by a significant decline starting in 1880, dropping to 25.1‰ by 1899, and then fluctuating downwards to 17.4‰ by 1935. The rate then rebounded and stabilized around 26‰, fluctuating downwards from 1960 to 2008, and reaching approximately 14.5‰ in 2009. In Taiwan, the data beginning in 1906 shows a fluctuating increase, with the birth rate peaking at 50‰ in 1951, followed by a rapid fluctuating decline to 7.2‰ by 2010. Overall, both New Zealand and Taiwan have experienced a declining trend in birth rates, particularly in Taiwan where the decline was more significant from the mid-20th century to the early 21st century.
