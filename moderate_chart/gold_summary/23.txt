The line graph illustrates the changes in refugee numbers in Lebanon from 1964 to 2023 and in the UK from 1951 to 2023, with both countries serving as host nations. In Lebanon, the number of refugees was 1,310 in 1964, followed by a massive influx in 1976 and 1977, reaching 700,000 people. Subsequently, the numbers fluctuated, with counts from about 20,000 in 2006 to about 50,000 in 2009. The numbers declined before surging to 130,000 in 2012 and then steadily climbing to a peak of 1.15 million in 2014. After this peak, the numbers continuously declined to 788,472 by 2023. In contrast, the UK's refugee numbers started at 208,000 in 1951, gradually decreasing to 100,000 by 1987, then dropping sharply to 39,755 in 1988. Following this decline, the numbers began to increase, reaching around 300,000 in 2005-2006. They then decreased from about 100,000 to 200,000, remaining relatively stable until a sharp rise in 2022, reaching 448,620 by 2023. Overall, Lebanon experienced significant fluctuations in refugee numbers, with a downward trend in recent years, while the UK has shown a marked growth trend.
