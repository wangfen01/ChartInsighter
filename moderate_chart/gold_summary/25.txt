This chart illustrates the annual changes in per capita coal CO₂ emissions in India, the UK, and the USA from the mid-18th century to 2023. In India, the per capita coal CO₂ emissions were merely 0.0016 metric tons in 1858, which then gradually increased to over 1 metric ton by 2014, reaching 1.41 metric tons by 2023. The UK started with a relatively high per capita emission of 1.00 metric tons in 1750, which steadily increased to a peak of 2.92 metric tons around 1800, followed by fluctuating upwards until around 1920. The emissions experienced sharp declines in 1921 and 1926, dropping to 6.84 metric tons and 5.23 metric tons, respectively, and then fluctuated around 9 metric tons until they began a steady decline post-1955, reaching 0.26 metric tons in 2023. The USA saw a steady rise from 0.042 metric tons in 1800, peaking in the early 20th century at over 15 metric tons in 1918. After this peak, the emissions generally trended downward, with fluctuations such as exceeding 10 metric tons during 1942-1945, then declining, briefly rebounding to over 7 metric tons in the early 21st century, and subsequently dropping to approximately 2.26 metric tons by 2023. Comparatively, the UK had high initial per capita coal CO₂ emissions, and both the UK and the USA experienced significant peaks in the early 20th century, followed by substantial and fluctuating declines. In contrast, India maintained relatively low per capita emissions until the late 20th century, showing a slow upward trend in recent decades.
