This line chart displays the change in the number of terrorist incidents in El Salvador and Lebanon from 1970 to 2021. During this period, both countries experienced fluctuations in terrorist activities, with the most rampant phase occurring from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. El Salvador exhibited significant fluctuations but maintained a higher level, with its number of terrorist incidents far exceeding that of Lebanon, peaking around 1980 with over 700 incidents. After this period, the number of terrorist incidents in El Salvador sharply declined to nearly zero. During the same period, Lebanon also experienced a large number of attacks, though far fewer than El Salvador, with numbers beginning to rise in 1970 and exceeding 200 by the mid-1980s, followed by a decline. Subsequently, the number of terrorist incidents in El Salvador dropped almost to zero, reflecting significant improvements in public security. In contrast, Lebanon continued to experience fluctuations in terrorist incidents, with about 200 incidents still occurring in the mid-2010s. From 1975 to about 1992, El Salvador led in the number of terrorist incidents.
