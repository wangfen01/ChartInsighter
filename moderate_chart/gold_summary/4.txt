This line graph shows the changes in fish landings over time for England and Wales as well as for the whole of the United Kingdom. For the entire UK, from 1889 to around 1910, there was an upward trend in landings, reaching a local peak in 1911 at 614099.8358. After this, landings continuously declined until 1917, then recovered and sharply rose to a peak of over 800000, followed by a sharp decline. From 1940 to 1945, there was a five-year trough period, after which landings recovered to previous levels and then gradually declined over time with fluctuations. For the England and Wales region, the overall trend is similar to that of the entire UK but with lower values. From 1889 to 1910, there was an upward trend, reaching a local peak in 1911, after which landings continuously declined until 1917, then recovered and sharply rose to a peak, followed by a sharp decline. This led to a trough period from 1940 to 1945, after which landings recovered to their original levels, and then gradually declined over time with fluctuations.
