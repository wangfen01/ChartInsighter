This chart displays the data on the sex ratio at birth for Algeria and China from 1950 to 2023, showing different trends over this 73-year period.       During this time, China's sex ratio at birth was mostly higher than that of Algeria.       In 1950, China's sex ratio was 105.86, increasing to 110.63 by 2023.       China's sex ratio saw a steady increase from the 1951, initially stable, then accelerating, rising from 104.89 in 1951 to a peak of 117.48 in 2006, after which it gradually declined to 110.63 in 2023.       In contrast, Algeria's sex ratio was relatively stable during this period, with larger fluctuations occurring in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1990s.       It started at 105.03 in 1950, peaking at 108.85 in 1965, then dropping back, and reached its peak again in 1976 and 1997.       For the rest of the time, it generally remained between 103 and 105, with a slight increase in recent years to 104.29 by 2023.       In recent years, as China's ratio has declined and Algeria's has slightly increased, the gap in birth sex ratios has begun to narrow.       However, as of 2023, China's sex ratio (110.63) remains significantly higher than that of Algeria (104.29).
