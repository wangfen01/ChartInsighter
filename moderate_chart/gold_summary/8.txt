This chart shows the trend of patent applications in India and Cuba from 1980 to 2021.   In 1980, Cuba had a significantly higher rate of patent applications, at 13.15 per million people, compared to India's 1.73.   However, over the next four decades, the two countries experienced very different trajectories.   India showed sustained and significant growth, particularly accelerating from the early 2000s.   In contrast, Cuba also showed a growth trend starting in 1980 but peaked around 1985 before plummeting to zero, then rebounded, and by 1994 started to decline again until 1996, then rebounded, remaining relatively stable between 1997 and 2005, and began to decline again after 2005.   By 2021, the situation had dramatically reversed compared to 1980.   India's patent application rate had significantly increased to 18.66 per million people, while Cuba's had decreased to 1.87 per million.
