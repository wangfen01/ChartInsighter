The chart presents a line graph that illustrates the changing percentages of the global population residing in urban and rural areas from 1960 to 2022. This data provides insight into the long-term demographic shift observed over these six decades, capturing the transition in living patterns across the globe.A detailed examination of the urban population trend reveals a persistent upward trajectory starting in 1960, at which point 33.60% of the world's population lived in urban areas. This figure consistently rose, reaching 56.90% by 2022. This steady increase underscores the global drive towards urbanization over the period analyzed. In contrast, the rural population displayed a downward trend. Beginning in 1960 with 66.40% of the population residing in rural settings, this percentage continuously declined, culminating in a low of 43.10% in 2022. This decline suggests a significant shift away from rural living environments over the decades.When comparing these trends, a clear inverse relationship is evident. As the percentage of the population in urban areas steadily increased, the rural population percentage consistently decreased. This shift underscores a broader demographic migration towards urban centers, marking a significant global trend towards urbanization over the past sixty years. This interrelated dynamic highlights the transformation in settlement patterns and lifestyle preferences across the globe during the specified timeframe.
