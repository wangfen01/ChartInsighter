The chart presents a line graph tracking coal consumption trends in two major regions, India and North America, spanning from 1965 to 2023. Each line represents the annual coal consumption within these regions, providing insight into their energy usage patterns over this extensive period.In India, coal consumption experienced a minor dip between 1965 and 1966, decreasing from 413.40735 metric tons to 412.41534 metric tons. Following this brief decline, India witnessed a substantial and sustained increase in coal usage, culminating in a consumption level of 6105.902 metric tons by 2023. This trajectory outlines a strong upward trend in India's coal consumption, reflecting possibly growing industrial demands and economic expansion.Conversely, North America showed a different pattern. From 1965, when coal consumption was 3412.8337 metric tons, North America saw a steady rise, reaching its highest point in 2005 at 6845.305 metric tons. Despite this earlier increase, a significant shift occurred post-2005, where the region encountered pronounced volatility and a declining trend, with coal consumption reducing sharply to 2486.6787 metric tons by 2023.When comparing the two regions, both began with upward trends in their coal consumption. India's increase was steady and sustained, whereas North America's increase peaked and turned into a decline after 2005. This divergence post-2005 is particularly noteworthyâ€”while India continued to grow its coal consumption, indicating a sustained dependency or expanding energy needs, North America entered a period of reduced coal dependency, possibly reflecting shifts towards alternative energy sources or improved efficiencies. The contrast between the continued rise in India and the decline in North America underscores significant regional differences in energy strategies and economic factors influencing coal consumption over these decades.
