The chart presents a comparative analysis of the share of adults who are overweight or obese across three countries—United Kingdom, Japan, and Nigeria—from 1975 to 2016. The data, represented as a line graph, captures the percentage of overweight adults aged 18 and above in these nations, making it possible to observe changes and trends over the 41-year period. In the United Kingdom, the chart shows a prominent upward trajectory in the percentage of overweight adults. The data starts at 40.1% in 1975 and steadily climbs to 63.7% by 2016. This substantial increase highlights the growing prevalence of overweight conditions over the decades in the UK, marking it as the country with the highest initial and final percentage among the three.Japan, on the other hand, starts with a significantly lower percentage of 14.9% in 1975. The trend illustrates a steady rise, culminating at 27.2% by 2016. This gradual increase, though less steep than that of the UK, demonstrates sustained growth in the prevalence of overweight adults in Japan over the years.Nigeria's trend is distinct yet follows the overall pattern of increase. Starting at 8.9% in 1975, it concludes at 28.9% in 2016. Notably, the growth in Nigeria becomes more pronounced post-2000, suggesting a sharper increase in the latter years of the time span.Analyzing these trends across the three countries, we observe a consistent upward pattern despite diverse cultural and geographical contexts. The United Kingdom's steep rise contrasts with Japan's and Nigeria's more gradual inclines, though all three maintain an increasing trajectory. The UK, with the highest figures, acts as a benchmark against which the rising patterns in Japan and Nigeria—though starting from lower baselines—are compared, substantiating a global trend towards higher obesity and overweight prevalence.
