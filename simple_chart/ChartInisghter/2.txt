The chart presents a comparative line graph of stock price trends for APPL and GOOG over a specified time range, highlighting critical changes from the early 2000s through early 2010. This data visualization sheds light on the fluctuations and patterns in stock pricing for these two major technology companies, captured through time-series analysis.Focusing on GOOG, its stock price marked a significant upward trend starting from its inception in August 2004, culminating at a high of USD 707.0 by October 2007. This ascent was followed by a decline that reached its lowest point of USD 292.96 in November 2008. Subsequently, a recovery phase led to a peak of USD 619.98 by December 2009. However, a slight downturn ensued, with prices reducing to USD 526.8 by February 2010. In contrast, AAPL's trajectory from January 1, 2000, began with a decline from USD 33.95 to USD 7.07 by March 1, 2003. This was followed by a substantial increase, achieving USD 198.08 by December 2007. A downturn was observed from late 2007 to December 2008, where the price decreased to USD 85.35. Post this phase, the stock experienced another sharp rise, reaching a considerable value of USD 223.02 by March 1, 2010.The analysis of these two datasets unveils striking similarities in their overall trends, particularly during key periods. Both GOOG and AAPL exhibited strong growth from the early 2000s up until the latter part of 2007, subsequently experiencing downturns throughout 2008. Recovery trends emerged for both stocks starting in late 2008 to early 2009. Despite these commonalities, a divergence is noted in early 2010, where GOOG saw a minor decrease, while AAPL continued to climb. This subtle variation underscores the unique market responses and operational statuses of each company within this shared recovery timeline.
