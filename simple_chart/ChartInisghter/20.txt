The chart presents a time series line graph tracking the annual patent applications submitted in China and Japan from 1985 to 2021. This visualization delineates trends in patent activity across two prominent markets: China and Japan, providing insights into their technological and innovation landscapes over several decades. In China, the time series begins with a decrease in patent applications from 4,065 in 1985 to 3,494 in 1986. After this dip, there is considerable volatility, yet the overarching trend is one of significant growth. The number of patent applications in China rose dramatically over the following decades, culminating in 2021 with an impressive peak of 1,426,644 applications. This trend indicates a robust expansion in China's patent filings, likely reflecting heightened innovation efforts and an aggressive push towards technological advancement. In contrast, Japan's patent applications displayed a different trajectory. From 1985 until the year 2000, Japan experienced a steady increase in patent filings, reaching a peak of 387,364. However, post-2000, there was a notable decrease in the number of patent applications, reflecting a downtrend that continued through to 2021, resulting in a reduced count of 222,452 applications by the end of the period. This decline suggests a shift in Japan's patent activity dynamic over the two decades after reaching their peak.When comparing these two dimensions, the contrasting trends become especially notable. Both countries began with an upward trajectory around the mid-1980s, but their paths diverged markedly after 2000. China’s patent applications surged remarkably, characterized by substantial growth and volatility, ultimately ascending to over a million annual filings by 2021. Conversely, Japan’s applications, after achieving an initial peak, experienced a decline post-2000, marking a period of contraction in patent activity. This divergence highlights the growing dominance of China in patent filings compared to Japan's diminishing numbers, reflecting differing trajectories in their respective innovation ecosystems.
