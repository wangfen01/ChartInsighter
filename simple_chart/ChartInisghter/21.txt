The chart presents a line graph illustrating the trends in fertility rates, measured as children per woman, from 1950 to 2023. This data is compared across several dimensions, focusing on Asia (UN), Iran, and global averages, referred to as "World."In Asia (UN), the fertility rate began with a steady decline from 1950, hitting a low point of 4.951 by 1961. A brief resurgence was observed from 1961 to 1963, peaking at 6.313. However, from 1963 onwards, the fertility rate showed significant fluctuations, decreasing steadily to reach a minimum rate of 1.881 by 2023.Iran's fertility trends started with an increase from 1950, peaking in 1959 at 7.571. Following this peak, a consistent decline ensued, with the rate dropping dramatically to its lowest at 1.74 by 2009. Post-2009, Iran continued this declining trend, albeit at a slower pace, leading to a fertility rate of 1.695 in 2023, save for a slight uptick in 2016 when it temporarily reached 2.054.For the global perspective, identified as "World," the fertility rate initially increased from 1950, peaking in 1963 at 5.308. Thereafter, similar to Asia and Iran, there was a noticeable and persistent decline amidst high volatility, eventually reaching 2.251 in 2023.Across these dimensions, a common trend is evident: all datasets demonstrated a marked peak around 1963, followed by a sustained downward trajectory in fertility rates. Despite region-specific fluctuations and varying rates of decline, the shared global trend post-1963 is one of decreasing fertility. Asia and the World exhibited continuous fluctuations throughout their decline, while Iran's decline was more steady, with only a few deviations such as the local maximum in 2016. This signifies a parallel shift towards lower fertility rates across different regions, influenced by broader demographic and socio-economic changes over the second half of the 20th century and into the 21st century.
