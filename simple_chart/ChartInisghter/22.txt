The chart presents a line graph that captures the trend of government health expenditure as a share of GDP from 1880 to 2020, focusing on Australia, France, and Japan. This time-series data provides a comparative perspective on how these countries' public health spending proportions have evolved over this extensive period.In Australia's case, the public health expenditure was notably low and stable at 0.0% of GDP from 1880 till 1900. From the beginning of the 20th century, there was a gradual and sustained increase in expenditure, culminating in a peak of 7.612% in 2020. France exhibited a slightly different trend with an initial decrease from 1880 to 1920, dropping from a peak of 0.29% in 1890 to a low of 0.23% in 1920. However, like Australia, France experienced a consistent rise in its public health expenditure post-1920, reaching a significant 10.338% in 2020. Japan demonstrated a distinct pattern of a steady rise throughout the entire period from 1880 to 2020, with its public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP increasing from 0.03% to 9.28%, showing minimal fluctuations.When examining these trends together, Australia's and France's early trajectories diverge from Japan's consistent increase; Australia and France both initially recorded periods of stable or declining expenditure. However, all three nations converge toward a common trajectory of increased public health expenditure from around 1920 onwards. This convergence reflects a broader global shift in prioritizing healthcare investment, albeit with differences in starting points and rates of increase. The data highlights a shared post-1920 commitment to rising healthcare spending, illustrating how diverse historical contexts have gradually aligned in recognizing and investing in public health as a crucial component of GDP.
