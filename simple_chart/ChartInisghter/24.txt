The chart under analysis presents a comparative view of the proportion of the female population in China, Oman, and Saudi Arabia over the extensive timeframe from 1960 to 2022.      This line graph offers insights into how the percentage of females relative to the total population has evolved in these three countries, providing a clear depiction of long-term trends and variations.

In China, the percentage of females in the population began with a gradual ascent reaching 48.969036% by 2022.      Oman, on the other hand, experienced a modest increase in female population percentage from 1960 until 1974, topping at 50.044%.      The subsequent twenty years saw a sharp decrease, bottoming at 41.209% by 1994.      This was followed by an upward trend from 1994 to 2003, where it peaked at 43.287%, before dropping significantly again until 2017, when it reached 34.808%.      Yet, a recovery phase began post-2017, with the figure climbing to 39.132% by 2022.      Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's female population percentage decreased considerably from 49.28234% in 1960 to a low of 42.790604% by 1995.      A minor recovery occurred between 1995 and 2022.  it settled at 42.378704%.

Across these three countries, patterns of similarity and difference emerge over the analyzed period.      A notable commonality is the recent increasing trend in female population percentages toward the end of the period across all regions: China's uptick started in 2012, Oman's since 2017, and Saudi Arabia's from 2019.
