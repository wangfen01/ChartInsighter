The chart presents a line graph highlighting the trends in electricity production from nuclear sources across different entities over a period from 1965 to 2023.   This data captures the variations in nuclear power generation, detailing fluctuations and growth patterns over time.  Initially, from 1965 to 2006, there was a pronounced upward movement in global electricity generation from nuclear power, ascending from a minimal 25.54 TWh to a peak of 2761.59 TWh in 2006.   This period was marked by significant expansion as nuclear power became a major component of the global energy mix.   However, this growth was interrupted between 2006 and 2012, where production dipped to 2432.22 TWh, signaling a decline period with 2006 marking a local maximum point within this timespan.   Following this decline, the trend shifted positively again from 2012 to 2021, with production climbing to another peak of 2762.24 TWh in 2021.   Nonetheless, this resurgence was not sustained, as a downturn occurred post-2021, reducing output to 2639.68 TWh by 2022, albeit with 2021 remaining the peak year for that interval.  Despite intermittent declines – notably from 2006 to 2012 and post-2021 – the data highlights a sustained long-term increase in nuclear power generation capacity, illustrating cyclical periods of growth and recovery.   These trends underscore a broader narrative of expansion with corrective phases, portraying the complexities and dynamics of nuclear power as a key energy resource over the decades.
