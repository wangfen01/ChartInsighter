The chart provides a detailed visualization of the yearly yield on ten-year government bonds in Belgium, covering the extensive period from 1995 to 2022.  This line graph captures the temporal trend of bond yields, inviting an understanding of changes across this nearly three-decade span. In examining the trend specific to Belgiumâ€™s government bonds, it is evident that the yield consistently declined from 1995, when it peaked at 6.71%, progressively lowering to reach a nadir of -0.15% by the year 2020.  This long-term downward trend reflects significant economic factors and policies impacting bond yields over the years.  However, a reversal occurs after 2020, where the yield undergoes a marked increase, rising sharply to 1.74% by 2022.  This recent uptick suggests an alteration in economic conditions or market perceptions affecting government borrowing costs in Belgium.
