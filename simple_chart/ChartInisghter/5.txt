The chart depicted is a line graph representing the unemployment rate trends in Tokyo from 2014 to 2023, segmented by gender. Specifically, it captures how unemployment rates have evolved over time for both males and females, offering a perspective on the city's labor market dynamics through these years.Between 2014 and 2019, the unemployment rate for males in Tokyo saw a generally downward trajectory. The rate was at its highest at 3.9% in 2014, and by 2019, it had decreased to 2.5%. Post-2019, the trend largely continued its downward path, despite a local peak at 3.4% in 2021, illustrating a resilient decrease through to 2023. During the same initial period from 2014 to 2019, females in Tokyo experienced a similar downward trend in unemployment rates, beginning at 3.6% in 2014 and reducing to a low of 2.2% by 2019. Following 2019, however, the pattern for females diverged somewhat as the rate experienced a slight uptick, peaking at 2.8% in 2020, before stabilizing with minimal fluctuations.The comparison across genders reveals significant insights. From 2014 to 2019, both male and female unemployment rates in Tokyo mirrored one another with pronounced decreases. However, their trajectories started to diverge post-2019. While both genders experienced local peaks relatively close in time—males in 2021 and females in 2020—the subsequent trends differed. Males continued to see a reduction in unemployment rates, whereas females settled into a steadier trend with less volatility. This divergence post-2019 underscores the nuanced variations in employment trends between genders in Tokyo's labor market during these years.
