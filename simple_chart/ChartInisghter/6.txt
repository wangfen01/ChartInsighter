The line graph presents the yearly working hours among all U.S. dentists over a period spanning from 1990 to 2022.  It captures the temporal changes in the average workload of dentists, highlighting significant shifts and overall patterns in their professional time commitment throughout these years. From 1990 to 2020, the data reveals a pronounced declining trend in the yearly working hours of U.S. dentists.  Beginning at a peak of 1810.6 hours in 1990, there is a consistent reduction in hours over the following decades, culminating at a low of 1448.8 hours in 2020.  This consistent downward movement suggests changing work habits, possibly influenced by broader societal and professional shifts. However, the trend takes a noticeable turn between 2020 and 2022, where a reversal is apparent.  During this period, working hours increased significantly, climbing to 1721.4 hours by 2022.  This uptick suggests a renewed or adjusted demand in dentist labor hours, hinting at possible post-pandemic adjustments or changes in workplace dynamics.
