The chart presents a line graph depicting the proportion of urban populations living in slums from 2000 to 2020 across four countries: Cuba, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, and the Philippines. This comparative analysis illustrates how each country's urban living conditions have evolved over the two-decade period. In Cuba, the proportion of urban populations living in slums remained exceptionally stable at 2.15% from 2000 to 2004. After this period of stability, there was a steady increase, culminating in a local peak of 10.54% by 2020. This indicates a significant deterioration in conditions despite the initially stable phase. In contrast, the Central African Republic showed a marked improvement: starting at a high 85.97% in 2000, the proportion of the urban population living in slums steadily decreased, reaching 68.91% by 2012. Cameroon experienced a similar downward trajectory; in 2000, 65.36% of its urban population lived in slums, but over 20 years, this figure more than halved to 32.67% by 2020. Similarly, the Philippines saw a gradual reduction in slum populations, with percentages dropping from 49.97% in 2000 to 36.62% by 2020.Examining the relationships between these trends reveals a common pattern of improvement in urban slum conditions for the Central African Republic, Cameroon, and the Philippines. These countries demonstrated consistent progress in reducing slum populations, suggesting effective urban development policies and initiatives. Cuba's trend, however, notably diverged, with an increase in slum population proportions that starkly contrasts with the declining trends observed in the other countries. This suggests distinct socio-economic challenges affecting urban areas in Cuba compared to its counterparts. Ultimately, these contrasting trajectories underscore the varied urban development challenges and successes experienced by these nations over the examined period.
