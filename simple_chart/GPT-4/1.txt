The chart describe the annual coal consumption across different entities from 1965 to 2023. It reveals notable differences in consumption trends among Europe, India, and North America. Europe’s coal consumption was initially high, peaking around 1979 with 9756.862 TWh, then experienced a steady decline, reaching a low of 2950.043 TWh by 2023, reflecting significant reduction efforts. India’s coal consumption, starting from a much lower base of 413.40735 TWh in 1965, shows a contrasting upward trend, climbing steadily to 6105.902 TWh by 2023, indicative of its growing energy needs and economic expansion. North America presents a somewhat cyclical pattern, peaking at 6722.444 TWh in 2000, then declining to 2486.6787 TWh by 2023, partly due to shifts towards alternative energy sources and economic changes affecting industrial coal use. The chart captures these divergent paths, highlighting the regional shifts in coal dependence over nearly six decades.
