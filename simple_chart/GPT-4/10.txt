The chart provides a clear depiction of the shifting dynamics between urban and rural populations from 1960 to 2022. Over these six decades, there is a pronounced trend of increasing urbanization. In 1960, only 33.60% of the population lived in urban areas, with this figure gradually rising each year to reach 56.90% by 2022. This consistent increase in urban population correlates with a reciprocal decline in the rural population, which decreased from 66.40% in 1960 to 43.10% by 2022. The crossing point occurs around the late 2000s, marking the first time when the urban population outnumbered the rural, highlighting a significant demographic shift towards urban living. This trend underscores the global movement towards urbanization as more people migrate to cities in search of better opportunities, a pattern reflected globally across various nations.
