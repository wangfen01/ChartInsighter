Examining the coal consumption data chart for Europe and India over a span from 1965 to 2023 reveals distinct trends and fluctuations within each region's energy usage patterns.

In Europe, coal consumption shows a general decline, particularly notable from the 1990 peak of 9756.862 TWh down to 2950.043 TWh by 2023. This reflects a broader shift towards alternative energy sources and a reduction in coal dependency. Significant dips are observed during economic or policy shifts, with sharp declines post-1990 and a more accelerated drop from 2019 to 2023. Conversely, from 1965 to the mid-1980s, the consumption was relatively stable, oscillating around 9400 TWh with minor year-to-year fluctuations.

India presents a contrasting scenario, where coal consumption has been consistently rising since 1965. Starting from a modest 413.40735 TWh, the consumption escalates steadily, reaching 6105.902 TWh by 2023. This increase aligns with India's industrial growth and its rising energy demands. The period from 2005 onwards is particularly marked by a rapid increase, reflecting India's accelerated economic expansion and increased reliance on coal as a primary energy source. The year-to-year growth has been relatively steady, with occasional spikes, such as the jump from 2456.1133 TWh in 2005 to 5562.6577 TWh in 2022, indicating substantial growth phases aligned with industrial and policy developments.

The divergence between Europe's declining and India's increasing coal consumption highlights different stages of economic development and energy policy shifts. While Europe moves towards a reduced coal dependency, India's growth trajectory relies heavily on coal, with implications for both regional energy strategies and global environmental impacts.
