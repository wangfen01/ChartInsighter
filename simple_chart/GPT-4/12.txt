The line chart illustrates the contrasting trajectories of coal consumption in India and North America from 1965 to 2023. Over this period, India's coal consumption has shown a robust upward trend, starting from 413.4 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 1965 and soaring to 6105.9 TWh by 2023, reflecting the country's escalating energy demands amid rapid industrialization and economic growth. Conversely, North America's coal consumption, while starting at a higher base of 3412.8 TWh in 1965, peaks around 6722.4 TWh in 2000 and then exhibits a marked decline, reaching 2486.7 TWh by 2023. This decline is indicative of a shift towards alternative energy sources and a broader deindustrialization trend. The chart effectively highlights these divergent patterns, underscoring the regional differences in energy strategy and consumption over nearly six decades.
