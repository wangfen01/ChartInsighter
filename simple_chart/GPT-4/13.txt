The line chart tracks public trust over several decades in China, the United States, and France, expressed as the percentage of the population agreeing that "most people can be trusted." The data reveals distinct patterns: China's level of trust fluctuates initially but shows an upward trend from 49.3% in 2010 to 63.5% in 2022, indicating a significant increase in societal trust. In contrast, the United States exhibits a general decline in trust from a high of 50% in 1993 to about 37% in 2022, with minor fluctuations in between. France's trust levels remain consistently low, hovering around 20% in the 1980s and 1990s, with a slight increase to 26.3% by 2022. These trends suggest varying dynamics in social trust across these countries, reflecting differing cultural, social, and possibly economic conditions influencing public perceptions of trustworthiness.
