From 2000 to 2010, both AMZN and GOOG exhibited significant fluctuations with an overall upward trend. AMZN started at $64.56 in January 2000, but by December 2001, it had dropped to a low of $5.97. Over the next few years, AMZN's stock steadily recovered, reaching $92.64 by the end of 2007. However, it dropped during the 2008 financial crisis, hitting $42.7 in November 2008, before rebounding and reaching $128.82 by March 2010. GOOG, on the other hand, started at $102.37 in August 2004 and steadily climbed, peaking at $707 in October 2007. Similar to AMZN, GOOG's stock fell during the 2008 crisis, reaching a low of $292.96 in November 2008, but it quickly recovered and reached $619.98 by December 2009. This demonstrates that both companies experienced steep declines during the 2008 crisis but showed strong recovery afterward, with GOOG generally having a higher stock price than AMZN throughout the period.
