The chart would illustrate the dramatic growth of air transport passengers in China and Japan over several decades, highlighting distinct trends and shifts in air travel in these countries. Starting from the mid-1970s, China shows a steep and almost uninterrupted increase in air passenger numbers, growing from just 710,000 in 1974 to an astonishing peak of nearly 660 million by 2019 before a sharp decline in 2020 due to global circumstances, showing resilience with a recovery in 2021. In contrast, Japan’s air passenger traffic started from 16.3 million in 1970 and exhibited steady growth, peaking at around 130 million by 2019, followed by a significant drop in 2020, mirroring global travel restrictions, with only a partial recovery by 2021. This trajectory underscores the massive expansion of China’s air travel market over the decades, outpacing Japan significantly in recent years, reflecting broader economic trends and possibly differing national aviation policies or economic conditions.
