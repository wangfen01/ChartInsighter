The line chart would display a marked contrast in the trajectory of patent applications between China and Japan from 1985 to 2021. While Japan's patent applications started at a high level in 1985 with 274,373 applications and peaked around 2000 at 387,364, there has been a gradual decline since, reaching about 222,452 in 2021, indicating a mature or possibly saturated innovation environment. In stark contrast, China shows a dramatic and continuous rise from a modest 4,065 patent applications in 1985 to an immense 1,426,644 by 2021, reflecting rapid industrial growth, increased R&D investment, and a strong push towards becoming a leading global innovator. This stark difference underscores not only the rapid evolution of Chinaâ€™s technological and industrial capacities but also shifts in global innovation landscapes, with China emerging as a dominant force in patent creation.
