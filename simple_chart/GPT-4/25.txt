The chart titled "Share of the Population that is Female, 1960 to 2022" visualizes the percentage of the female population as a part of the total population in Oman over a period of 62 years. This line graph reflects not only demographic trends but also provides insights into the changing gender composition of Oman, influenced by various socio-cultural and possibly governmental policies over the decades.
Initially, the percentage of the female population in Oman shows a steady increase from 49.82% in 1960 to a peak of 50.04% in the early 1970s, indicating a balance approaching a 50-50 split between genders. However, from 1975 onwards, there is a notable decline, reaching a significant low of 34.81% in 2017. This sharp decrease could be attributed to several factors, including migration, changes in birth rates, and specific national policies or economic conditions affecting the female population differently.
After reaching this low, the trend reverses somewhat in subsequent years, with a gradual increase observed up to 39.13% in 2022. This recovery could suggest a stabilization or changes in the factors previously causing the decline, such as alterations in immigration patterns, improvements in female health care, or changes in governmental policies towards gender equality.
Overall, the graph illustrates a significant fluctuation in the gender ratio, highlighting a unique demographic profile that would require deeper investigation to understand all contributing factors. These trends are crucial for policymakers and researchers to consider when planning for future social services, educational programs, and health care facilities tailored to the demographic composition of Oman.
