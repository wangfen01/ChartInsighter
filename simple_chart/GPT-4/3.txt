The chart illustrates the trajectory of global electricity production from nuclear sources from 1965 to 2023, showing a significant increase in nuclear energy output over nearly six decades. Starting from a modest 25.54 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 1965, nuclear electricity production witnessed a steep rise, achieving a sharp escalation to 203.90 TWh by 1973 and further accelerating to a peak of 2754.08 TWh in 2019. The data exhibits periodic fluctuations, particularly notable post-2010, where production sees a dip to 2432.22 TWh in 2012, reflecting the impact of global events on nuclear energy usage. Despite such variations, the overall trend remains upward, signifying a growing reliance on nuclear energy amidst the evolving energy landscape. The data also hints at a resurgence post-2020, suggesting a continued commitment to nuclear energy in the global energy mix.
