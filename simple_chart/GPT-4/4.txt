Between 1995 and 2022, the yearly yield on ten-year government bonds in Belgium exhibited a generally downward trend, with notable fluctuations in certain periods. In 1995, the yield started at 6.71%, but by 1998, it had dropped to 4.11%, before increasing again to 5.42% in 1999 and peaking at 5.6% in 2000. A gradual decline followed, with the yield reaching 3.43% in 2005. From 2005 to 2015, the yields consistently dropped, reaching 0.85% in 2015. The lowest yield was recorded in 2020 at -0.15%, marking a significant negative shift. Post-2020, yields began recovering, with 1.74% recorded in 2022. The overall trend suggests a long-term decrease in bond yields, particularly after 2000, culminating in negative yields in 2020 and a slight rebound afterward.
