The chart spans from 2014 to 2023, detailing annual unemployment rates for males and females in Tokyo. With an average unemployment rate of about 2.94% and moderate yearly fluctuations (standard deviation of approximately 0.50%), the data suggests a generally stable economic environment with unemployment peaking at 3.9% and dipping to a low of 2.2%. While the data includes both genders, it indicates that the unemployment scenario has remained consistently under 4%, reflecting minor variations rather than significant economic shifts over the ten-year period. This stability might mask subtle differences between male and female unemployment trends, which could provide deeper insights if analyzed separately. Overall, the unemployment rate in Tokyo over these years shows mild variations that might reflect broader economic policies and labor market conditions.
