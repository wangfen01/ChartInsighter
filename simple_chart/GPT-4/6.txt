From 1990 to 2022, the yearly working hours of U.S. dentists showed a general decline with occasional fluctuations, followed by a recovery in recent years. In 1990, the average yearly working hours were 1,810.60, but by 2000, they had dropped to 1,720.30. The trend continued downward in the early 2000s, reaching a low of 1,654.40 in 2014. However, after 2014, there was a gradual recovery, with hours peaking again at 1,715.60 in 2019. A significant drop occurred in 2020, with working hours falling to 1,448.80, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021 and 2022, the working hours bounced back to 1,681.70 and 1,721.40, respectively, indicating a return to pre-pandemic levels. Overall, the data reflects a long-term reduction in working hours for dentists, with a notable disruption in 2020 and a subsequent recovery.
