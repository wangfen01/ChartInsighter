From 2008 to 2022, Afghanistan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has experienced significant growth and fluctuations. In 2008, GDP was US$1.03 billion, and then peaked at US$1.789 billion in 2011, demonstrating several years of consecutive steady growth. Growth during this period may have been driven by international aid and internal development policies. However, after 2013, GDP growth slowed down and began to fluctuate, with GDP of US$2,017 million and US$2,062 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively, suggesting a bottleneck in economic growth.
Between 2015 and 2017, GDP declined, falling to US$1,802 million in 2016, reflecting the impact of possible political instability and security concerns on the economy.After 2018, GDP picked up slightly but remained below 2014 levels, indicating challenges to economic recovery. By 2020, GDP increases slightly to US$2,014 million, likely due to a brief recovery in economic activity. However, in 2021 and 2022, GDP falls to $1,429 million and $1,447 million, respectively, a significant decline that may be related to the COVID-19 epidemic and political instability, exposing the high sensitivity and vulnerability of the Afghan economy to external shocks. These data points reflect the economic volatility of Afghanistan in the face of multiple economic challenges and external dependencies.
