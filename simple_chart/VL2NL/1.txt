The visualization is a line chart that represents the annual coal consumption measured in terawatt-hours (TWh). The chart plots data from different entities over a series of years. The x-axis corresponds to the 'Year', which is treated as an ordinal variable, while the y-axis represents the 'Coal Consumption (TWh)', which is a quantitative measure. Each entity's coal consumption trend is depicted by a line with a unique color, and the entities included in the sample data are Europe, India, and North America. There are no interactive features or data transformations indicated in the chart description. The visualization likely depicts a time series showing the coal consumption trends for Europe, India, and North America from 1965 to 2023. It highlights India's growth to become the highest coal consumer by 2023, starting from the lowest in 1965, and Europe's significant decrease in coal consumption by 6598.75 TWh over the same period. The average coal consumption figures—Europe leading with 7062.73 TWh, followed by North America at 4986.63 TWh, and India at 2048.14 TWh—indicate regional differences and shifts in energy usage over time.
