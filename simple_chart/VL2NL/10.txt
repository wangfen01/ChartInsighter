This is a line chart that depicts the percentage of the total population living in urban and rural areas from 1960 to 2022. The chart plots the years on the horizontal axis as an ordinal variable and the percentage of the total population on the vertical axis as a quantitative measure. Lines on the chart are colored differently to represent the two nominal categories: urban and rural areas. The data for this visualization is sourced from a CSV file named 'data.csv'. There are no additional transformations or interactive features specified for this chart. The visualization likely depicts a diverging trend over time, with the percentage of the total population living in urban areas steadily increasing from 1960 to 2022, while the percentage living in rural areas decreases by an equivalent magnitude. The change for both urban and rural populations is symmetrical, with each shifting by approximately 23.30% over the 62-year period, indicating a significant demographic shift from rural to urban living.
