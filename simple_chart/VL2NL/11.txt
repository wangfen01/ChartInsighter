This visualization is a line chart that depicts the coal consumption in Europe and India from 1965 to 2023. The data is plotted with the year on the x-axis and coal consumption in terawatt-hours on the y-axis. Each region, Europe and India, is represented by a distinct line color, allowing for easy comparison between the two. Interactive tooltips provide additional information about the year, coal consumption, and region when a user hovers over the chart. The visualization likely depicts a time series graph showing the trend of coal consumption in TWh for Europe, with a peak in 1965 and a noticeable decline of 67.75 TWh by 1969. India's coal consumption data is absent, preventing any comparative analysis or trend observation for the region within the given timeframe.
