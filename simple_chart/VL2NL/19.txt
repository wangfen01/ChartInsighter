This is a line chart that visualizes the air transport passengers carried in China and Japan over time. The data is plotted with the year on the horizontal axis and the number of air transport passengers carried on the vertical axis. Lines representing each country are distinguished by color, with a legend indicating which color corresponds to which country. Interactive tooltips provide additional information about the year, number of passengers carried, and the country when a user hovers over the chart. The visualization likely depicts a time series showing the number of air transport passengers carried in China over various years, highlighting the peak at 1,540,000 passengers, the minimum at 710,000 passengers, and an average of 1,082,000 passengers per year. However, it does not include data for Japan, preventing any comparative analysis between the two countries.
