This visualization is a line chart that displays patent applications by residents in China and Japan over time. The data is plotted with the year on the horizontal axis and the number of patent applications on the vertical axis. Each line represents one of the two countries, with color used to differentiate between them. Interactive tooltips provide additional information, showing the year, the number of patent applications, and the country when a user hovers over the chart. In 2021, China reached its peak in patent applications with 1,426,644 submissions, significantly surpassing Japan's highest year in 2000. On average, China files more patents annually with approximately 343,773 applications compared to Japan's 313,007.4, and in the most recent year, China's patent applications were more than six times that of Japan's.
