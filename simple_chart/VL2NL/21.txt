The visualization is a line chart titled "Fertility Rate: Children per Woman". It represents the fertility rate, measured as the number of children per woman, over time. The data is sourced from a CSV file and includes temporal information by year, quantitative fertility rates, and nominal entities such as 'Asia (UN)', 'Iran', and 'World'. The chart uses lines to depict changes in fertility rates over the years for each entity, with different colors representing different entities. The x-axis corresponds to the year, while the y-axis represents the fertility rate. Interactivity is provided through tooltips that display detailed information about the entity, year, and fertility rate when a user hovers over a point on the line.The visualization likely depicts a dramatic decrease in Iran's fertility rate from a peak of 7.571 in 1959 to a low of 1.695 in 2023, with Iran's average fertility rate over the period being higher than the world average but lower than that of Asia (UN).
