The visualization is a line chart that depicts the electricity production from nuclear sources over time. The data is plotted with the 'Year' on the horizontal axis and 'Electricity from Nuclear (TWh)' on the vertical axis. Each line in the chart represents an 'Entity', with the example entity being 'World'. The chart is designed to show trends in nuclear electricity production across different years, with the ability to distinguish between different entities based on color encoding. The visualization likely depicts a rising trend in global nuclear electricity production from 1965, starting at a low of 25.5397 TWh, to a peak in 2021, with the last decade's average production being 2617.66 TWh. The overall increase in production over the observed time frame is approximately 2660.2 TWh, indicating significant growth in nuclear energy output worldwide.
