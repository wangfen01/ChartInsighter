The visualization is a line chart that depicts the proportion of the urban population living in slums, represented as a percentage, over various years. Each line in the chart corresponds to a different entity, such as 'Cuba', 'Central African Republic', and 'Cameroon', with the entities distinguished by color. The horizontal axis represents the years, treated as ordinal data, while the vertical axis shows the proportion of the urban population living in slums, treated as quantitative data. The chart aims to show trends or changes in the proportion of urban populations living in slums across different entities over time. The visualization likely depicts a downward trend in the proportion of urban population living in slums for Cameroon from 2000 to 2004, indicating a significant improvement, while the Central African Republic consistently shows a much higher percentage compared to Cuba, which maintains a relatively low and stable proportion of its urban population living in slums during the same period.
