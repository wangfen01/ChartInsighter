The chart shows a line graph of coal consumption over time in India, Europe and North America. North America showed a steady upward trend from 1965, peaking at 6837.884 in 2007, but has declined dramatically in recent decades. Europe was the highest in the beginning but underwent ups and downs before a sharp decline since 1990. At the same time, India's coal consumption has been growing steadily. At the outset, coal consumption in Europe and North America was much higher than in India, with Europe taking the lead, however in recent years, India's coal consumption has gone from exceeding the levels of those two regions.
