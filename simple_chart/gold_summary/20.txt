The chart shows a line graph of patent filings in China and Japan over time. China's rapid growth in patent applications from 4,065 in 1985 to over 1.42 million in 2021, despite a small dip in 2019, reflects the importance China places on innovation. In contrast, Japan slowly increased in the first half and slightly decreased after 2000. Japan's patent filings peaked at 387,364 in 2000 and then declined to 222,452 in 2021. China's growth at first lagged behind, but surpassed Japan's in 2006 and continues to grow.
