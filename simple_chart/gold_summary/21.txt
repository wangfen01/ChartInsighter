The chart illustrates the trends in fertility rates from 1950 to 2023 for Asia, Iran, and the World. Overall, they all exhibit a significant decline in fertility rates over the period. The number of children per woman in Asia starts at 5.694 in 1950 and will decline to 1.881 by 2023.  Although minor fluctuations occurred between the 1950s and 1970s, particularly in the 1960s-1970s, the general trend remained downward. Iran's fertility rate began higher at 6.97 in 1950, peaked at around 7.571 in 1959, and then steadily decreased to 1.695 in 2023. The rate sharply declined after the 1970s, with more rapid reductions in the late 20th century. Overall, the world fertility rate started at 4.852 in 1950 and decreased to 2.251 by 2023. The global rate showed a consistent decline, with slight increases in 1960-1965. In comparison, while all regions show declining fertility rates, Iran had the highest initial rate but converged to the lowest by 2023.
