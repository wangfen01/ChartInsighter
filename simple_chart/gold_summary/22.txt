In Australia, the percentage of GDP allocated to public health was zero from 1880 to 1900. It began to improve in 1910 and saw significant increases starting in 1960, following a generally fluctuating upward trend, reaching its peak at 7.612 in 2020. In France, the percentage of GDP spent on public health markedly increased to 2.19 in 1860, followed by fluctuating growth and a rapid rise to 10.34 by 2020.

Despite some fluctuations, the overall trend continued to rise, reaching 9.28 in 2020. All three countries showed significant upward trends in public health spending, with Japan and France experiencing more pronounced growth than Australia.
