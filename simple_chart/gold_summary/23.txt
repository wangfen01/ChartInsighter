The line graph displays the changes in the percentage of GDP that Japan has spent on public health from 1880 to 2020. From 1880 to 1930, Japan's public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP was low and grew slowly. After entering the 1960s, the proportion began to rise significantly, with a rapid increase from 1.73% to 3.04% during the 1960s to 1970s. The rate continued to fluctuate and rise, accelerating around 2010, and ultimately reaching 9.28% in 2020. Overall, Japan's public health spending as a percentage of GDP has shown a significant growth trend over the past 140 years, particularly during the rapid rise from the latter half of the 20th century to the early 21st century.
