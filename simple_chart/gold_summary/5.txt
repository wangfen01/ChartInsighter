This chart represents a line graph of the unemployment rate for men and women in Tokyo over time from 2014 to 2023.   The unemployment rate for men started at 3.9% in 2014 and steadily declined to 2.5% in 2019.   However, in 2020, the unemployment rate spiked to 3.3% before rising slightly to 3.4% in 2021.   A recovery ensues, with the unemployment rate falling to 2.8% in 2022 and 2.6% in 2023.   The unemployment rate for women begins to decline from 3.6 percent in 2014 and falls more sharply than for men, reaching 2.2 percent in 2019.   Like men, the female unemployment rate rose to 2.8 percent in 2020, but the recovery is faster and more stable.   By 2021, the female unemployment rate will fall to 2.5 percent and stabilize in 2022 before falling slightly to 2.4 percent in 2023.
Comparing the two sexes, female unemployment declines more rapidly from 2014 to 2019, while male unemployment improves gradually.   In 2020, the pandemic caused unemployment to rise for both men and women, but women recovered more quickly and their unemployment rate stabilized sooner than men's.
