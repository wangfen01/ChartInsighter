This chart represents a line graph of the change in annual hours worked by dentists in the U.S. from 1990 to 2022. In 1990, the average annual hours worked by dentists in the U.S. was 1,810.60, which was the highest value in the dataset. Between 1990 and 2000, the average annual hours worked showed a downward trend and then showed a more stable change. However, 2020 was an extreme outlier, with hours worked falling sharply to 1448.80 hours. This was followed by a strong recovery in 2021 when hours rebounded to 1,681.70 hours, and by 2022, hours returned to pre-2000 levels, peaking at 1,721.40 hours.
