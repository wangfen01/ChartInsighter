The figure shows changes over time in the proportion of the urban population in slums in the Central African Republic, Cuba, Cameroon, and the Philippines. Central African Republic fell from 2000 to 2012 when reaching a plateau of 68.91. Cameroon and the Philippines kept dropping throughout the time. In comparison, Cuba rose from start to end. The Central African Republic, Cameroon, and the Philippines all had higher urban population ratios than Cuba between 2000 and 2020, but all three countries show an overall declining trend, with Cameroon having been overtaken by the Philippines in recent years, while Cuba's urban population ratio has been growing steadily and the gap between it and the three countries above is narrowing.
